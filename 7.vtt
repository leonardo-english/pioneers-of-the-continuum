Pioneers of The Continuum.

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.032
A story for English learners.

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:16.494
Episode seven, "Utopia", starring Christian Saunders from Canguro English.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:20.191

00:00:29.973 --> 00:00:36.173
My name is Julian and I’m an optimist, I’m a “glass half full” kind of guy.

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:42.973
My entire life, I’ve had this conversation with people: Will the future

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:48.403
be a “utopia” - a perfect world where people live in peace and harmony,

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:55.283
or a “dystopia” - a broken, destroyed world where humans live in misery.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:01.653
I was firmly on the side of “utopia”, but my fellow team members weren’t.

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:08.043
You see, we had been testing out our time machine, making short one-hour trips.

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:14.093
Out of the seven of us, six had already gone - I was to be the last.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:18.343
But, whereas they all travelled to either the near or distant

00:01:18.383 --> 00:01:22.963
past, I would be travelling one hundred years into the FUTURE.

00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:28.603
Jacob imagined that I would arrive in a world ravaged by nuclear war.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.873
Ellie thought that I would arrive in a world destroyed by pollution.

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:37.843
Winston told me to expect a totalitarian government that

00:01:37.843 --> 00:01:41.813
forced people to work and live as slaves to the rich.

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:43.113
And me?

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:46.403
I imagined that I would be welcomed as a hero!

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:52.123
Our time travel research was top-secret for now, but in 100 years,

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:57.443
people would look back and see us as the Einsteins or Teslas of our age.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:04.073
After all, one of the main reasons we have all been recording our experiences of our trips to the

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:12.323
past is for posterity, as historical records, to allow you to listen to exactly what happened.

00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:19.022
And speaking of the future and the past, our present situation was becoming

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:24.652
somewhat more tenuous, and there were serious faces on the morning of my trip.

00:02:25.656 --> 00:02:29.941
Marcie was projecting a story from the news onto a nearby wall.

00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:33.041
“Check this out,” she said, reading the headline.

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:39.111
“Government to impose severe penalties on unauthorised quantum research.”

00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.321
“And they mention our company, QETT Industries, by name!”

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.721
Jacob spoke up, “The government is not as powerful as it used to be.

00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:55.611
If they decide to investigate us, we can threaten to move our company back to the Pacific

00:02:55.631 --> 00:03:01.751
Islands or join the Silicon Valley Conglomerate where we’ll be outside of government control.”

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.911
Winston narrowed his eyes.

00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:07.141
“Okay, but…”

00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:11.141
“Guys, guys…” I raised my hand to quieten them.

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.931
Was it just my imagination or had the team been acting

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.091
weird recently, since we started the time journeys?

00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:20.901
“Guys, come on.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.828
I’m bursting to get going.

00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:25.858
Can you press the button already?” I pleaded.

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:30.638
Jacob looked at me, “Are you sure you don’t want a radiation suit?”

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:33.488
“I’ll be FINE,” I insisted.

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.368
Winston was fiddling with the controls.

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.268
“That’s strange,” he said.

00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:40.558
“I can only get one QE point.”

00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:44.864
“What, in the year 2139?” I asked.

00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:52.044
“No,” he explained, “I can only find one quantum entanglement point in the entire future.

00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:59.151
It’s roughly 500 years from now and it’s… right here in this exact spot.”

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.821
I considered his words.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:05.741
500 years into the future was a long time.

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:10.271
And it was odd that the only QE point was right here.

00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.231
Our research had suggested there were an infinite

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.561
number of quantum entanglement points in the future.

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:20.441
“  Let’s do it,” I said.

00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:21.471
“I’ll do it.

00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:22.331
Let’s go.”

00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:24.911
Gabriel looked doubtful.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:30.831
“But Julian… you don’t know… I mean, humans might be extinct, the

00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:35.361
Earth could be destroyed, you might die within seconds of arriving…”

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:37.601
I waved off his concerns.

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:44.171
A pioneer has to take some risks, and with the authorities getting jumpy, I didn’t want to delay.

00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.741
“Send me through.”

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:50.911
Winston looked reluctant, but he pressed the button and…

00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:00.566
I found myself… in a strange room.

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:06.396
The floor was white, the walls were white and the ceiling was white.

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:10.356
The only thing in the room was a man sitting on a chair.

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:12.926
He looked like he was waiting for me.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:19.436
He wore a white suit with white trousers and he had no expression on his face.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:24.706
He had black hair, combed back away from his face and slicked down.

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:28.066
Looking around, I noticed something strange.

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:33.466
The walls and the floor were smooth and… seemingly without texture.

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:37.236
What kind of materials did they have here in the future?

00:05:38.016 --> 00:05:42.046
I looked at the man, waiting for him to speak, but he said nothing.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:44.206
He was observing me.

00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:46.586
“I’m Julian,” I said.

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:51.396
“I travelled here from the year 2039… in a parallel timeline.

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:54.176
Using quantum entanglement through time.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.506
QETT, we call it.”

00:05:57.976 --> 00:06:00.976
“We know,” said the man after a short pause.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:02.536
We?

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:06.126
He was the only one here as far as I could see.

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:10.046
This was not the hero’s welcome I had been expecting.

00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:14.886
On the other hand, the world hadn’t been ravaged by a nuclear war.

00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:16.726
I began to relax.

00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:20.586
Anyway, I could leave anytime if things got too weird.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.096
“What do you mean ‘we’?

00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:25.296
What is this place?” I asked.

00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:27.166
“Who are you?” I added.

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:32.336
“We,” he said, “are the Collective, and we have been waiting for you.”

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:34.976
“The Collective?” I asked.

00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:36.766
“But I only see one of you!”

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:41.216
The strange man moved his hand, as if signalling to someone.

00:06:46.164 --> 00:06:48.484
Instantly, our surroundings changed.

00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:51.714
Instead of a small room, I was in a large room.

00:06:52.284 --> 00:06:55.744
Three other people were standing around, observing me.

00:06:56.664 --> 00:06:58.854
Had they been there this entire time?

00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:06.144
They were all… plain looking… exactly like the man, who still hadn’t told me his name.

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:09.454
And they were all dressed in white with black hair.

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:16.363
The people held electronic devices and there was some kind of computer bank behind them.

00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:21.303
Only the floor was the same as before, plain white.

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:23.723
“How did you do that?

00:07:24.103 --> 00:07:25.493
What happened?” I asked.

00:07:26.173 --> 00:07:27.623
“Simple,” replied the man.

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:30.543
“I removed the first layer of the simulation.”

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.863
Shocked, I looked around the room.

00:07:34.693 --> 00:07:38.503
What I saw before was a simulation… but how…?

00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:40.333
I needed more information.

00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:43.893
I asked, “What kind of simulation?

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.953
I mean… I’m not wearing goggles…”

00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:51.363
The man replied, “We can beam a simulation directly to your mind.

00:07:51.843 --> 00:07:58.053
Remember, compared to ours, your world is, how can I put it, primitive”

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.513
“And this is real?” I asked.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.995
“ What I can see right now…is this reality?”

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:09.555
The man looked as if answering these questions was tedious.

00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:11.125
“Mostly.

00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:14.415
But part of what you see is still a simulation.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:18.015
It’s how we choose to live, in our time period.”

00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:19.755
I looked around the room.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.325
What was real and what wasn’t?

00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:26.815
I noticed there was no door - that must be part of the simulation!

00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:29.835
But something else was bothering me.

00:08:30.605 --> 00:08:33.505
These people were not friendly, not at all.

00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:37.205
I hadn’t seen one smile or greeting from any of them.

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:40.275
Had common courtesy gone extinct?

00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:42.525
I tried a different approach.

00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:47.065
“In my timeline…, I mean, where I come from, it’s

00:08:47.355 --> 00:08:50.165
customary to tell people your name when you meet them.

00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.935
I’ve told you my name… Julian.

00:08:53.045 --> 00:08:57.575
Now, I would feel more… comfortable… if you told me yours.”

00:08:58.695 --> 00:08:59.845
“Fine,” said the man.

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:03.615
“I am CHX-23095.”

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:06.015
He motioned to the others.

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:15.675
“This is CHX-23096, CHX-23097 and AAA-00239.”

00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:19.665
“You’re robots,” I gasped.

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:22.315
I looked at the “people”.

00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:26.485
Earlier I had noticed that they looked somewhat the same.

00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:31.265
Now I realised that they looked almost exactly the same.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:33.585
Robots had taken over!

00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:35.365
Or had they?

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:41.325
“Where are the humans?” I demanded, trying to control the anger and anxiety in my voice.

00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:47.765
The man replied, “We ARE the humans, but, yes, we have been ‘upgraded’

00:09:47.805 --> 00:09:52.442
with robotic systems, collective information processing, AI.

00:09:53.205 --> 00:09:55.785
Put simply, we’ve evolved.”

00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:57.885
The man continued.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:02.435
“AAA-00239 has a legacy name, Andrew.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:07.655
He was born only a few years after 2039, your time.”

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:11.555
“You’re 500 hundred years old?” I gasped, shocked.

00:10:12.473 --> 00:10:15.925
“495 to be precise,” said Andrew.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.845
My head was swimming with thoughts.

00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:22.415
The technology here was amazing, beyond belief.

00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:27.025
They controlled reality, they lived for 500 years.

00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:28.915
But at what cost?

00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:33.355
They claimed to have evolved, but evolved into what?

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:37.065
They looked and behaved more like machines than people.

00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:40.455
And they seemed to have no emotions.

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:41.905
A utopia?

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:43.525
I think not.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.715
“So, what now?” I asked.

00:10:47.285 --> 00:10:50.495
“I’d like to… learn more about your world.”

00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:52.545
Andrew stepped forward.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:57.395
“We’re going to ask you some questions and then perform some tests on you.

00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:02.845
If you cooperate, you may depart for your own time in a few days.”

00:11:04.075 --> 00:11:07.175
As I was trying to digest what he was saying, coloured

00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:11.035
lines appeared around my body, moving down the contours.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:17.720
As this happened, a screen on the wall displayed my height, weight, age and other data.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.970
Wait… how did it know my age?

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.580
“A few days?” I asked.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.446
“You must know that I can leave anytime using the chronotrigger.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.770
And I can…”

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.640
I stopped, searching my pockets.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.850
Where was it?

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.597
Where was the chronotrigger?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.180
CHX-23… whatever his name was, was holding it up.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.000
How did he get it?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.310
More technological tricks!

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.290
“Looking for this?” he asked.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.150
“And we’ve disabled your safety mechanism.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.660
You’ll stay here for as long as we want you to stay here.”

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.950
I gulped.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.780
This was taking a dark turn.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.380
What should I do?

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.860
Should I cooperate?

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.880
I considered my next move.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.840
Meanwhile, Andrew began questioning me.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.350
“Did the United States still exist in your timeline when you left?”

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.580
“Yes,” I replied.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.240
“Who was the president?”

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.460
“President Elon Musk,” I replied.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.040
This seemed simple enough.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.080
He just wanted to note the similarities and differences between his timeline and mine.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.380
“Was the quantumnet operational?” he asked.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.050
“The quantum what?” I said.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.180
He pushed a button on his device, his face showing no expression.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.780
“Show me any implants you have,” he continued.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.770
I activated the touchscreen on my arm and a panel slid back.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.100
Before I could stop him, another of the men stepped forward, grabbed my arm and inserted a cable.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.210
“Hey, watch it!” I exclaimed.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.250
“Don’t be so rough.

00:12:56.427 --> 00:12:57.580
What’s wrong with you people?”

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.490
But I knew what was wrong with them.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.550
They weren’t people at all.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.240
They were cold, emotionless machines pretending to be human.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.280
Then I saw my chance.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.540
The first man still had my chronotrigger in his hand.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.920
I couldn’t stay here.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.350
This could be my only chance to escape before they might do all kinds of tests on me.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.960
It was too much; I had to get out.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:28.830
I pulled the cable from my arm, lurched forward and snatched the chronotrigger out of his hand.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.100
Then, I ran blindly towards the nearest wall, searching for a hidden door.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.830
To my surprise, one appeared!

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.970
I burst through it and emerged into a corridor.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.870
It was a long, white corridor with no doors in it.

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:46.699
Another simulation!

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:53.979
I ran down it anyway, reaching the end, to find no hidden door… just a screen.

00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:55.549
The screen read:

00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:59.899
Collective Facility 2002-X1.

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:05.808
Our mission: to prevent or disrupt all time travel activity in historical timelines.

00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:12.029
As I heard the sound of running behind me, I realised I would be caught in a few seconds

00:14:12.859 --> 00:14:14.129
There was nothing else to do.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:17.629
I pressed the chronotrigger… and prayed.

00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:25.127
I was back in the lab, back in my own time, surrounded by my team,

00:14:25.477 --> 00:14:30.017
people that at least I knew were actual humans, my flesh and blood!

00:14:31.207 --> 00:14:36.347
“The good news,” I told them, “is that the world still exists 500 years from now!

00:14:37.107 --> 00:14:38.297
The bad news…”

00:14:39.237 --> 00:14:40.007
I paused.

00:14:40.397 --> 00:14:41.857
Something wasn’t right.

00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:45.487
Ellie’s purple and green hair was gone.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:48.507
It was back to its natural brown colour.

00:14:49.607 --> 00:14:54.787
Winston had a sort of Hitler-like moustache, instead of being clean shaven.

00:14:55.197 --> 00:14:57.257
And Jacob wasn’t there at all.

00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:01.967
Standing in his place was a man who I had never seen before.

00:15:02.927 --> 00:15:03.967
Oh my God!

00:15:04.257 --> 00:15:05.737
This wasn’t my timeline!

00:15:06.827 --> 00:15:11.197
They were all staring at me with odd expressions on their faces.

00:15:11.647 --> 00:15:14.217
They seemed… confused about something.

00:15:15.157 --> 00:15:16.227
Winston spoke up.

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:18.427
“Jerome, we need to talk.

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:21.007
We really need to talk.”

00:15:22.381 --> 00:15:25.591
“  It’s Julian,” I said with a sinking feeling.

00:15:26.161 --> 00:15:29.411
“My name’s not Jerome, it’s Julian.”

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.260
Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:42.690
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:48.146
Julian was played by Christian Saunders from Canguro English.
