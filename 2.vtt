Pioneers of the Continuum.

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:09.029
A story for English learners.

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:15.040

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.240

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:34.438
Yes, I have to admit that I was a little jealous that

00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:37.708
Winston was the first one of us to travel through time.

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:42.488
He came face to face with Adolf Hitler, and put a bullet in his brain.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:45.518
Or so he told us at least.

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:48.048
But now it was my turn.

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:54.128
I had spent months brushing up on my Latin, working on my cover story and going through ancient

00:00:54.128 --> 00:01:01.490
records to pinpoint exactly where Julius Caesar would have been on the 10th of November, in 54 BC.

00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:06.538
Luckily, the Romans kept meticulous historical records, a fact

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:10.308
that I would use to my advantage since I’m a historian myself!

00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:16.368
See, I wasn't so interested in changing the course of history or assassinating anyone.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:21.568
I wanted to go back and actually meet Julius Caesar before he became really famous.

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:25.488
I wanted to meet him for myself, to get the measure of the man.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.078
And now I was about to do it.

00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:32.468
I got into the box-like chamber that would transport me through time,

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:36.578
ignoring the teasing comments from the others about my Roman robes.

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:39.888
I closed my eyes and asked them to proceed.

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:50.095
Immediately, the air felt different, colder.

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:52.225
There was noise all around.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.455
The sounds of clanking metal and orders being shouted.

00:01:56.025 --> 00:02:00.755
I opened my eyes to find I was in a large tent full of military supplies.

00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:02.075
It had worked!

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.265
I rose to my feet and made sure that I was holding the

00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:08.879
trigger device that would send me back - the chronotrigger.

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.955
After all, things could turn dangerous, and fast.

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:18.015
My urge was to examine the shields, swords and armour stacked in the tent.

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:20.795
I mean, this was a historian’s dream!

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.925
But I wasn’t here to look at artefacts, I had a mission.

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:26.555
I was here to find Caesar.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.625
Stepping out of the tent, I looked around.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.045
Amazing!

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:36.575
Roman military camps were always built in the same layout: a large rectangle with four

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:42.455
gates, several “roads” including one through the middle and the general’s tent in the centre.

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:44.945
It could be constructed in three hours.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.565
I had studied it and now here I was!

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:49.305
“ Quis es?

00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:52.485
Quid tu hic agis?” called out a voice.

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:54.125
It was a legionary.

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:55.911
Latin!

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.382
I had spent years studying it, but this was the first

00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:02.792
time I had heard it spoken outside of a simulator.

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:05.962
“I’m lost,” I replied in Latin.

00:03:06.722 --> 00:03:09.962
“I’m looking for General Gaius Julius Caesar.”

00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:16.682
It was the first time in thousands of years that anyone had spoken Latin to a real Roman.

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:18.302
I hoped it would work…

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:20.082
“Baldie?

00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:22.372
What would he want with you?

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:24.082
And what’s that accent?”

00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:27.872
Did he just refer to Caesar as “baldie”?

00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:31.133
I know that Caesar was bald, but it was amazing to hear

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:34.943
his own men referring to him in such a derogatory way!

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.463
Right, it was time for my cover.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.323
“I’m Xenophes, a historian from Greece.

00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:46.703
I’ve travelled here to Gaul to compile a history of your great general.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:48.553
I’d very much like to meet him.”

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:54.573
You see, I was hoping that claiming to be Greek would explain away my accent.

00:03:55.283 --> 00:03:58.873
And Caesar loved publicity - he surely wouldn’t turn

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:01.793
down an opportunity to feature in the history books!

00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:05.133
The legionary considered my words.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:09.103
Meanwhile a couple of his fellows came up to see what was happening.

00:04:10.343 --> 00:04:15.633
“Well, I’m sure Baldie would love that - as long as you write about how wonderful he is.

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:19.113
But you’re out of luck; he’s away for a couple of days

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:22.493
meeting a local chieftain and accepting his submission.

00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:25.073
We’ll put you up in a tent if you want.

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.333
I’m Valerius, by the way”

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.773
The words crushed me.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.613
I had successfully travelled here right to the heart of

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:38.443
Caesar’s camp and I made contact without arousing any suspicion.

00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:43.623
But I only had an hour before being automatically triggered back to my own time.

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:46.913
Of course, I couldn’t tell these men all that.

00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:49.533
But what could I do here for a single hour?

00:04:50.153 --> 00:04:51.933
Time to put my thinking cap on.

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:57.183
“I’m not only interested in General Caesar,” I told the group.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.513
“I’m writing a new kind of history.

00:04:59.563 --> 00:05:02.953
I want to learn about the common soldier; the legionary.

00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:06.813
Take me on a tour of the camp and tell me about yourselves.”

00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:11.393
I figured it was worth a short at least and when I

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:14.943
saw Valerius’ face lighting up, I knew I was in luck.

00:05:16.223 --> 00:05:20.683
“Well,” Valerius said, “That sounds acceptable.

00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:25.053
We’re just about to go on a short patrol, but we’ll be back before nightfall.”

00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:28.583
Dammit, I was about to lose my opportunity.

00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:30.073
One last chance!

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:32.353
“Perfect!” I cried.

00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:33.233
“Take me with you!

00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:34.343
I’ll write about it.”

00:05:34.953 --> 00:05:37.693
It was risky, but what other choice did I have?

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:44.933
And one of the men stepped forward, saying “We don’t take random Greeks on patrol with us.

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:47.993
Can you defend yourself when the Gauls attack?”

00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:52.933
“Yeah!” I replied, knowing full well that that was a lie.

00:05:53.193 --> 00:05:57.673
I had never been in a fight in my life, let alone against a fearsome Gaul.

00:05:58.563 --> 00:06:02.393
And there was something about what he'd said that confused me.

00:06:03.283 --> 00:06:07.993
He said “when” the Gauls attack, not “if” they attack.

00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:13.263
Still, I would only be here for an hour, so how dangerous could it be?

00:06:14.453 --> 00:06:15.803
Valerius took my wrists.

00:06:16.713 --> 00:06:18.523
“Look how soft his hands are.

00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:21.493
This Greek’s been living the good life, by Jupiter.

00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:22.963
And what’s this?”

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:25.441
He had my chronotrigger.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.433
Damn, I wasn’t expecting them to find it.

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:30.503
“It’s a good luck charm.

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:31.773
I carry it everywhere.”

00:06:32.613 --> 00:06:34.913
Luckily, he seemed uninterested in it.

00:06:35.883 --> 00:06:40.223
“No doubt it’s dedicated to Zeus or some such Greek nonsense.

00:06:40.523 --> 00:06:41.893
Do you know what these are?”

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:47.293
Valerius showed me a short sword and a spear that he took from the man next to him.

00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:51.175
" A gladius and pilum", I replied.

00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:55.645
Now I'm guessing you're not a historian, so you might not know either.

00:06:55.945 --> 00:07:00.925
A gladius is a sword and a pilum is a spear,  the kind the Romans used.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:04.785
I took the pilum from him and held it in my hands.

00:07:05.864 --> 00:07:11.304
In high school, I competed in javelin events, and I was sure I could handle this seven-foot spear.

00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:14.494
I held it above my head in a throwing pose.

00:07:15.454 --> 00:07:19.924
“Okay, Greek,” Valerius replied, at least somewhat impressed.

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:23.644
“Drusus, fetch the others and we’ll leave immediately.”

00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:29.803
“ Marcus Antonius won’t like it if we take the Greek with us”, moaned Drusus.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:32.293
“Never mind about that.

00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:35.243
It looks like the Greek wants to meet some Gauls.

00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:37.223
We’d better introduce him!”.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.783
Some of the legionaries laughed.

00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:44.833
And so it was that a few minutes later, I found myself walking

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:48.883
through the forest in ancient Gall with a patrol of nine legionaries.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.425
Valerius took the lead and I realised that he must

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:57.345
be decanus - leader of a group of eight to ten men.

00:07:58.095 --> 00:07:59.985
The forest was thick and dark.

00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:03.075
The legionaries spaced themselves out so that they were

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:06.985
walking several metres apart and they fell completely silent.

00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:12.625
I kept pace with Valerius, eager to gain more information in my limited time.

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:17.385
He was reluctant to talk much while on patrol, but he humoured

00:08:17.385 --> 00:08:21.455
me and I learned that his men were part of the thirteenth legion.

00:08:22.025 --> 00:08:25.245
Now, if this timeline held the same as mine, this

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:28.825
meant that these men were about to go down in history!

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:35.425
Caesar famously crossed the Rubicon river into Rome with a single legion and triggered a civil war.

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:38.395
That legion was the thirteenth!

00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:43.661
And the Marcus Antonius he had mentioned back in camp must have been

00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:49.021
Marc Antony, Caesar’s protege who went on to become Cleopatra’s lover.

00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:52.801
I kicked myself - I should have asked them to introduce me!

00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:58.281
I thought we were striking up some kind of relationship, Valerius and I, so

00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:03.071
I decided to ask him if he thought “baldie” was a good leader to his men.

00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.661
That was not a good idea…

00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:11.141
When he heard me refer to Caesar in this way, Valerius spun around and held

00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:16.241
his gladius to my throat, his face a matter of centimetres away from me.

00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:19.264
“You don’t call him that, Greek.

00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:20.084
Ever.”

00:09:20.844 --> 00:09:24.484
He could probably see the terror in my expression, and after he

00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:28.594
put his sword down his voice softened and he answered my question.

00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:32.627
“ He has brought us what every Roman soldier wants.

00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:34.467
Honour and glory.

00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:37.487
Riches and land will follow in time.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:41.977
I believe that once we have subdued the Gauls, we will join him in the

00:09:42.007 --> 00:09:47.177
greatest honour of all, a triumphal procession through the streets of Rome!”

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:51.777
Hearing this caused a strange sensation to come over me.

00:09:52.437 --> 00:09:56.077
I knew that Caesar would really conquer the Gauls, winning victory after

00:09:56.077 --> 00:10:00.547
victory to become one of the greatest military leaders of all time.

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:07.197
And these men would really get their triumph, although it was a few years and many battles away.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:12.817
I felt a burning desire to tell Valerius of the glory that lay ahead for him.

00:10:13.477 --> 00:10:15.597
And then I thought, why not?

00:10:16.707 --> 00:10:20.377
“Valerius, before I left Greece, I consulted an oracle.

00:10:20.757 --> 00:10:23.627
She told me that Caesar really would subdue Gaul.

00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:28.948
You’ll defeat their leader Vercingetorix in one of the greatest battles in history.

00:10:29.268 --> 00:10:30.988
You’ll get your Triumph in Rome.”

00:10:32.344 --> 00:10:34.814
He went silent, looking down at the ground.

00:10:34.824 --> 00:10:34.834
“Hmmph!

00:10:35.874 --> 00:10:39.214
You Greeks should stick to your dramas and philosophy.

00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:43.784
The leader of the Gauls is Viridovix, not Vercingetorix.”

00:10:44.854 --> 00:10:48.244
Although he dismissed my prediction, Valerius continued with

00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:51.896
a bit of a spring in his step, he seemed pleased by my remark.

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:53.986
I smiled to myself.

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:58.036
If Viridovix was the leader of the Gauls, that was proof that

00:10:58.036 --> 00:11:02.516
I'd come to a slightly different timeline, exactly as I'd hoped.

00:11:03.766 --> 00:11:08.046
Time to bring the conversation back to the present day, the present hour, even.

00:11:08.956 --> 00:11:11.956
“Do you think we’ll really encounter the Gauls today, Valerius?”

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:14.016
“I’m sure of it, Greek.

00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:15.666
That’s why we’ve come this way.”

00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:20.386
I realised that this was not really a patrol, but a provocation!

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:23.836
Valerius was seeking a fight, hoping for a battle.

00:11:24.556 --> 00:11:26.726
Had I made a big mistake coming along?

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:31.335
There was no way I could hold my own in a fight against an army of Gauls!

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:38.146
Still, I probably had only fifteen minutes or so left; I just needed to stick it out until then.

00:11:38.736 --> 00:11:43.816
After all, I had my chronotrigger, I could push the escape button if I really needed to.

00:11:44.866 --> 00:11:46.396
“Valerius,” I said.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.126
“What if we’re outnumbered?

00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:49.706
There are only ten of us.”

00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:51.776
Valerius laughed.

00:11:52.506 --> 00:11:53.486
“Outnumbered?

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:57.356
Of course we’ll be outnumbered, or they wouldn’t dare attack us!

00:11:57.356 --> 00:11:58.216
We’re Romans.

00:11:58.216 --> 00:11:59.956
We’ll fight them like Romans.”

00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:03.426
I considered this.

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:07.686
Caesar was vastly outnumbered in nearly all of his major battles.

00:12:08.136 --> 00:12:13.056
The one time he actually outnumbered his enemy, he won so easily that he summed

00:12:13.056 --> 00:12:19.617
up the battle in three words":  veni, vidi, vinci [I came, I saw, I conquered].

00:12:20.437 --> 00:12:24.817
The legionaries wouldn't fear a large number of Gauls, but I would.

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:27.337
I felt my stomach tighten in fear.

00:12:28.142 --> 00:12:31.452
Valerius motioned for me to be quiet and pointed up ahead.

00:12:31.972 --> 00:12:36.542
The patrol slowed and grouped closer together as we eventually came to a clearing.

00:12:37.252 --> 00:12:39.352
I wondered if I could make a run for it.

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:41.442
“Come out, Gauls.

00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:45.732
I know you’re here!” shouted Valerius to the surrounding trees.

00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:53.021
And out from the shadows stepped a group of fearsome Gauls, painted head to toe in various colours.

00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:56.541
They carried spears, sticks and swords.

00:12:56.971 --> 00:12:58.561
Some carried wooden shields.

00:12:58.881 --> 00:13:00.281
There were fifteen of them.

00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:05.331
I didn’t hear a command, but the legionaries immediately formed

00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:10.388
into two lines, their shields locking together noisily,  swords

00:13:10.418 --> 00:13:14.568
protruding from the first line and spears protruding from the second.

00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:17.958
A hand grabbed me and pulled me into the back line.

00:13:18.738 --> 00:13:24.238
The Gauls screamed, shouted, threatened, shook their weapons and hurled insults.

00:13:24.948 --> 00:13:31.648
Meanwhile, the Romans maintained complete silence and lack of emotion, their focus complete.

00:13:32.038 --> 00:13:37.418
The might and discipline of the Roman war machine was embodied in this small detachment.

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:41.188
And then there was me, shaking in fear.

00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:45.458
The tight Roman formation emphasised the difference

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.678
in numbers, as the Gauls spread out in front of us.

00:13:49.438 --> 00:13:54.228
As they shouted and gathered courage for an attack, I noticed one Gaul staring

00:13:54.228 --> 00:14:00.038
directly at me, and I knew what he was thinking: a soft target, an easy kill.

00:14:01.398 --> 00:14:06.618
As I stared back, his eyes never left mine, burning with anger and hatred.

00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:13.368
It reminded me that the Romans were invaders here, occupiers in the middle of a genocide.

00:14:14.138 --> 00:14:17.708
He would run me through with his spear in an angry rage.

00:14:18.688 --> 00:14:21.878
“Release arms!”, Valerius shouted.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:27.568
Five pila soared through the air, easily finding their marks in the throats

00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:32.298
and chests of five Gauls who fell to the ground in their death throes.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.908
Suddenly the field was even - ten against ten.

00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:40.608
The remaining Gauls hesitated, realising what they were dealing with here.

00:14:41.428 --> 00:14:44.368
“Advance!”, roared Valerius.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:50.298
The Roman formation advanced towards the enemy, taking advantage of their hesitation.

00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:56.308
I stepped back, letting them go on without me; later they'd surely

00:14:56.308 --> 00:15:00.658
call me a coward, but I was in no position to worry about “later”.

00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:05.478
At that moment, half the Gauls attacked while the other half fled.

00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:10.608
Four Gauls charged the Roman formation, a move of pure suicide.

00:15:10.998 --> 00:15:14.638
The fifth Gaul charged directly towards me, spear

00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:18.718
thrusting forward, a wild battle cry piercing the air.

00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:20.838
In desperation.

00:15:20.868 --> 00:15:24.779
I held out my pilum to deflect the blow, but the enemy warrior

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:29.229
moved to the left at the last moment, thrusting his spear into my…

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.686
I was back in the lab.

00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:39.376
Blood was trickling from my stomach where the very tip of the spear

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:43.836
had pierced me just before I had been pulled back into my own timeline.

00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:46.406
It was the closest of escapes.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.730
“ Caesar wasn’t as happy to see you as you’d hoped, it would seem?”

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.930
asked Winston, motioning for Marcie to pass the first aid kit.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.940
I laughed in relief.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.800
Somewhere in another timeline, over 2000 years ago, was a

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.340
very confused warrior whose enemy had vanished upon contact.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:14.200
I suppose he was probably cut down by some cold Roman steel a few moments after that.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.430
Ancient times were bloody and brutal, and as soon as I returned,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.300
I made a promise to myself to leave history firmly in the past.

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:33.059
Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:38.489
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:16:39.073 --> 00:16:43.963
Bobby was played by Andrew Bates from Culips English Podcast.
