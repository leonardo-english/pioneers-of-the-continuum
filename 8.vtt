00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:33.752
As I wandered around my apartment, the morning after

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:37.322
my trip to the future, one thought occupied my mind.

00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:39.462
I had to get out of here.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.520
By here, I meant this… false timeline.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.460
I had to get back to MY timeline.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.670
When I got back, the team were calling me JEROME.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
And they said I looked different - they expected my hair to be blonde instead of brown.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.950
And THEY looked different to me, too!

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.830
Winston had that little moustache.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.100
Jacob was gone and replaced by an entirely different person!

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.420
He said his name was George.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.510
After some discussion, it seemed obvious what had happened.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.360
Instead of returning to my own timeline, I had returned to a PARALLEL timeline - a

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.370
time in the present which was similar to mine but not exactly the same.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.580
In the future that I had visited, I met unfriendly “people” who were part human and part machine.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.780
I had learned that they wanted to put a stop to time travel.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.820
But why?

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.000
And did they send me back to the wrong timeline on purpose?

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.690
What’s more, although none of them had mentioned it before, the other team members

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.930
had also experienced differences in their timelines since returning… but subtle ones.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.910
Winston’s neighbour no longer had a dog.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.170
Marcie’s mum called her by a different nickname.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.780
Ellie found cow, not soy milk, in her fridge that she could have sworn she would never have bought.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.860
Little things like that.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.530
The differences were small enough that they hadn’t mentioned them to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.590
anyone… until I returned with a different name and different coloured hair!

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.310
Had EVERYONE returned to a different timeline?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.570
Time travel was turning out to be more complex than any of us had imagined.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.450
This couldn’t go on!

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.530
Last night, back at my apartment, I called my mother and when she picked up the line,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.250
I didn’t recognise her voice, there was a woman with an American accent on the line!

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.030
I was supposed to call my girlfriend, but I didn’t

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.390
dare - she’d call me Jerome or have no idea who I was.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.400
And half the stuff in my apartment was different - the furniture, the books, the clothes.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.310
Why was the sofa yellow?

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.440
I couldn’t live here like this!

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.160
On the way back to the lab, there were protestors again.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.560
“NO MORE EXPERIMENTS!” one sign said.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.710
Perhaps the protestors were right, but before stopping any further experiments,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.140
I needed to get back to my own timeline… I needed to get back home.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.250
Inside the lab, I told Winston my idea: “Send me to a parallel timeline in the PRESENT!

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.590
It doesn’t even matter if it’s my own original one, but I need it to be closer than THIS.”

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.120
Despite being the supposed visionary, Winston always took time to come around to new ideas.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.540
“I don’t know,” he said.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.680
“We agreed that we would do seven trips and then spend a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.850
few months analysing the outcomes before travelling again.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.130
We have to be responsible scientists.”

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.840
I held my hand up to my forehead.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.680
“Winston, that’s easy for you to say.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.050
You belong here, even with that silly moustache.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.600
I don’t.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.340
I just want to…”

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.610
Winston held up his hand to cut me off.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.980
“If you travel to an alternate present, there will already be a Julian there.”

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.700
I corrected him, “You don’t know that.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.860
What happened to the ‘me’ from this timeline?

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.830
He’s probably in my world, eating my mum’s cooking and dating my girlfriend!”

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.990
Winston rolled his eyes.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.720
“It’s a crazy idea and you know it.”

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.010
Marcie chipped in, “I don’t think it’s crazy at all, Winston.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.000
You mentioned responsibility.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.430
Don’t we have a responsibility to fix what we’ve messed up?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.430
And it’s technically possible to do, right?”

00:04:42.857 --> 00:04:45.100
Just then, Gabriel burst into the room.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.350
“Team,” he said, out of breath, “We’ve got trouble!

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.400
The authorities are raiding us.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.410
They’re trying to get in the building right now as we speak.”

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.430
Winston looked worried.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.730
“Can our security hold them off?”

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.880
“No,” replied Gabriel.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.830
“We’ve got eight guards but they’ve sent about 20 agents.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.230
We can probably keep them out of the building for just a few

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.400
minutes and we can hold the lab for another 20 minutes or so.”

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:14.515
Back in my timeline, the government had been getting less

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:18.805
powerful and large corporations had been getting more powerful.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:25.995
In my timeline, it was unlikely that the government would raid us, but here, it must be different.

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:30.685
The idea kept flashing in my mind: I had to get home.

00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:36.425
Our lab area had extra security and only the seven of us were

00:05:36.455 --> 00:05:40.125
ever allowed to enter - we even did the cleaning ourselves.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.405
But government agents could break down the door eventually.

00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:48.285
“Listen, everyone,” I said, “Once the authorities get in here, they’ll shut

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:52.525
down the lab, confiscate the equipment and I’ll never get the chance to return.

00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:54.055
Come on and help me!

00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:57.035
We’ve got just enough time before they break in here.”

00:05:58.155 --> 00:05:58.985
The others nodded.

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:02.685
“We should all go,” said George, Jacob’s replacement.

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:06.705
“Wherever we end up, at least the authorities may not be onto us.

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:09.765
And if it’s no good, we can time jump again.”

00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:12.785
“But me first,” I insisted.

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:16.365
“And make it permanent… no one hour safeguard.

00:06:16.365 --> 00:06:17.325
No chronotrigger.

00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:19.035
I won’t be coming back.”

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:24.195
Everyone stood silent for a moment, but then sounds of shouting

00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:27.395
and commotion from the front of the building jolted us into action.

00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:33.125
Working quickly, I placed myself in the transporter box while the others prepared the machine.

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:37.855
It came on and began scanning for quantum entanglement points.

00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:43.075
Winston looked at the screen, and started to speak, “Okay,

00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:49.135
same time, same place, but parallel universe...I’ve got one!

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:54.855
But I don’t like it… only one point shows up when there should be thousands.

00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:56.815
Remember what happened last time?”

00:06:57.455 --> 00:07:00.185
There was banging on the door of the lab and the sound

00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:02.695
of muffled voices shouting through the heavy door.

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:04.935
“Do it, Winston,” I told him.

00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:05.765
“Do it now!”

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:07.905
I closed my eyes.

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:11.315
We had been to the past and we had been to the future.

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:16.345
It was time for the last frontier: I would be travelling to the present.

00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:18.305
A different present.

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:19.575
Hopefully.

00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:28.451
Suddenly there was… silence.

00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:30.661
I opened my eyes.

00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:38.701
I was in the lab, but it was empty… no computers, no machines, no time travel equipment.

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:45.481
And standing in front of me, expectantly, was… another me!

00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:53.401
It’s a great shock to come face to face with yourself… It's a bit like looking in a mirror.

00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:56.631
But my mirror image’s clothes were different.

00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:03.948
They were much more old-fashioned, like something from 1839, not 2039.

00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:09.214
The other me - let me call him my ‘clone’ - said, “Welcome!”

00:08:10.684 --> 00:08:11.714
“Thank you,“ I said.

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:12.024
“What...

00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:13.044
What’s happening?

00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:14.274
Where am I?

00:08:14.714 --> 00:08:17.974
I… haven’t come to the right place, have I?”

00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:22.744
My clone looked at me with something that seemed like pity.

00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:24.914
“No, you haven’t,” he said.

00:08:25.284 --> 00:08:30.034
“I will explain everything in just a minute… but I’m expecting a couple more to come through.

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:32.844
They usually come through at this time of day…”

00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:34.834
I was puzzled.

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:36.474
A couple more what?

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:37.644
Come through where?

00:08:38.524 --> 00:08:40.434
My clone moved me to the corner of the room.

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:42.854
“Stand there, out of the way,” he said.

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:46.774
And just like that, another me appeared.

00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:48.324
And then another.

00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:49.424
And then another.

00:08:49.994 --> 00:08:50.644
And another.

00:08:51.644 --> 00:08:54.964
There were six versions of me standing in the room.

00:08:55.894 --> 00:09:02.464
We were all dressed almost completely alike and our hairstyles, everything was the same.

00:09:03.534 --> 00:09:07.704
Only the clone who had been waiting for me was wearing old-fashioned clothes.

00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:11.714
And only he seemed to know what was really going on.

00:09:12.854 --> 00:09:14.024
“Right then,” he announced.

00:09:14.234 --> 00:09:16.064
“Call me Julian 1 for now.

00:09:16.564 --> 00:09:20.224
The first thing you need to do is to open your arm implants and turn them off.”

00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:23.708
I looked briefly at the other Julians.

00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:26.674
Then, I did as Julian 1 requested.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.324
I opened my arm implant and powered down the system.

00:09:31.414 --> 00:09:33.724
I immediately felt different.

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:35.584
I felt… freer.

00:09:36.634 --> 00:09:37.846
Julian 1 continued.

00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:42.815
“ You travelled to the future and the Collective used a virus to control your mind.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:46.495
They made you WANT to time travel again to get home.

00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:50.145
The same virus infected the time machine and sent you here.

00:09:50.535 --> 00:09:52.695
It was all part of their plan.”

00:09:53.935 --> 00:09:56.295
The freedom I had felt evaporated.

00:09:57.255 --> 00:10:01.505
Julian 1 continued, “More Julians have been arriving every day.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:03.695
There are over 100 of us now.

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:05.465
I’m different.

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:07.435
I’m from this timeline.

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:12.655
I set up this lab with my friend Winston, to research electromagnetism.

00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:18.808
We moved the equipment to another room to make space for… arrivals.”

00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:21.148
Electromagnetism?

00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:22.178
…I thought to myself.

00:10:22.218 --> 00:10:26.448
But… that’s ancient technology, from the start of the 19th century!

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:30.108
Julian 1 produced a stack of papers.

00:10:31.018 --> 00:10:35.538
“The first one of you to arrive brought this letter, and I’ve made several copies.

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:36.958
Please read it.” he said.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:39.709
I took one of the letters.

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:41.839
It had been copied by hand.

00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:44.889
Were there no photocopiers in this timeline?

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:46.959
I read the letter.

00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:49.369
Dear Time Traveller,

00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:53.649
We have transported you and your colleagues to a specific timeline.

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:59.399
In this timeline, time travel has not been invented and it will never be invented.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:03.249
We simply cannot allow further disruption of timelines.

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:08.879
It threatens the Collective and the progress that we have made towards the ideal society.

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:14.609
We estimate that we will need to send several thousand of you to exile on this timeline.

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:16.729
We will send five per day.

00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:20.979
Your team members have been exiled to different timelines.

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:24.189
Do not make any attempt at further time travel.

00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:26.739
If you do, punishment will be severe.

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:28.509
Enjoy your life.

00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:30.319
[signed] The Collective

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:34.452
I looked up and I glanced out the nearby window.

00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:37.659
I saw a city seemingly from the past.

00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:42.429
There were factories and houses, but there were no cars,

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:46.309
buses, power cables or other signs of modern technology.

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:51.579
It looked like I would be stuck here in this backwater - a timeline

00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:54.929
where technology had barely advanced to the industrial era.

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:58.849
I mentioned before that I’m an optimist.

00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:01.399
Well, here was the ultimate test.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.719
“Well, you handsome guys,” I said.

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:07.329
“Let’s go see Julian 1’s lab.”

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.739
“Great idea Julian,” said one of the other Julians.

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:13.419
“I’ll come too,” another Julian piped up.

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:16.039
“Got room for another Julian?”, said another.

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:19.039
“Sure, Julian”, I said to the Julians.

00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:25.259
I sighed, looked around at the other mes, all the Julians, and opened the door.

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:31.234
I was going to need to get very comfortable spending time  in my own company.

00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:39.037
Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:44.467
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:12:45.153 --> 00:12:49.923
Julian was played by Christian Saunders from Canguro English.

00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:55.666
If you enjoy the series then, please tell a friend about it and leave a review.

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:57.106
Thanks for listening.
