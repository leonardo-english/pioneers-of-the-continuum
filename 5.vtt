Pioneers of The Continuum.

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.032
A story for English learners.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:16.467
Episode five, "Too Soon?", starring Anna Tyrie from English Like A Native.

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:20.036
You can find the interactive transcript, subtitles

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:25.143
and  vocabulary for this episode for free at leonardoenglish.com

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:37.275
So, it’s okay for you MEN to romp around naked with cavegirls and fulfill your

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:44.285
fantasies of meeting toxic ‘alpha males’ like Hitler and Julius Caesar, but I can’t

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:49.695
go back to the 1800s and take part in a simple protest for equal rights for women!”

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:56.105
Yet again, it was Winston and his merry men with their ridiculous double standards.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:57.645
It needed to be said.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:03.795
“No, Ellie, that’s not what I’m saying at all!” Winston said with a sigh.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:06.055
I saw him roll his eyes.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:06.855
Typical!

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.425
“I’m just saying,” he continued in classic Winston

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:16.335
style, “that you need to tone it down a little bit.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:22.845
The purple and green hair, your t-shirt… they won’t have seen things like that before.”

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:27.435
Ugh, God, he really didn’t understand, did he?

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:33.565
My t-shirt, by the way, said ‘F*** the Patriarchy’ in big, bold letters.

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:36.275
I was wearing it for a reason.

00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:37.755
I continued.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:44.855
“That’s the point, Winston, to show people things they haven’t seen before.

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:46.695
To get them thinking.

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:52.455
They want the right to vote, but I want to get them thinking…it’s not just gender

00:01:52.505 --> 00:02:00.425
equality, it’s eating a plant-based diet, LGBTQ rights, racial equality, anti-capitalism…”

00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:04.295
I couldn’t finish before Bobby interrupted.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:11.855
“Ellie,” said Bobby, “they won’t know what those things are, and they probably won’t care!

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:16.095
They’re suffragettes - what they want is the right to vote.”

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:20.998
“ You men are all the same, always trying to control women!

00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:21.978
Right, Marcie?”

00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:25.108
I was hoping she would back me up.

00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:28.388
I mean, she was the only other woman on the team.

00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:34.568
“What?” Marcie said, “Oh, yeah, I suppose.”

00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:38.028
I noted her lack of enthusiasm.

00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:45.058
Well, she still ate meat - in this day and age - so she couldn’t be trusted!

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:51.488
“Anyway, we agreed that we could all choose what we would do and where we would go”

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:56.158
I climbed into the container that would transport me through time.

00:02:57.408 --> 00:03:02.318
“And in case you’ve forgotten, guys, it will be a parallel

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:06.178
timeline, so it won’t affect things here - unfortunately!

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:09.378
Now, press the button and send me through!”

00:03:10.688 --> 00:03:12.758
Bobby and Winston were shaking their heads.

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:14.508
Toxic behaviour!

00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:17.158
But they did press the button, at least.

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:26.466
I found myself in a cold and damp warehouse.

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:28.386
Exactly as planned!

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:34.326
I was in the men’s toilets - also as planned, I knew that

00:03:34.326 --> 00:03:36.836
it would be empty in the middle of a suffragettes meeting!

00:03:37.806 --> 00:03:43.556
Noises of activity and excited female conversation drifted in from the main area of the warehouse.

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:47.646
I opened the door and walked boldly out into the group

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:51.166
of ten or so women standing around a long work table.

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:57.276
They were chatting excitedly as they painted signs and prepared sashes and banners.

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:03.346
One sign read, “Votes for Women!” Another read, “We Demand the Vote!”

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:07.256
Conversation stopped as they all turned and stared at me.

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.856
Jaws dropped in surprise.

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:15.256
They were each and every one dressed in long white flowing dresses.

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:18.336
And they all wore flowery hats.

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:22.846
The display of unity was impressive, but I was disappointed

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.746
that they weren’t dressed in a more… empowered way.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:30.836
“Greetings, Sisters!” I announced.

00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:35.166
“My name is Ellie and I’m here to help you prepare for your march!”

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:41.146
One of the ladies stepped forward, the one who seemed to be in charge.

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:43.576
“Who told you about our march?

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:45.916
It’s a closely kept secret.

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:48.876
And… WHAT are you wearing?”

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:55.706
“Well,” I said confidently, “I have my own intelligence network.

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.406
And do you like my clothes?

00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:01.206
It’s the latest fashion where I come from.”

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:06.516
“And where exactly would that be?” asked another of the ladies.

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:11.856
“It’s a small island in the Atlantic Ocean, south of Bermuda.

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:15.216
It’s called… Sardesia.

00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:17.526
You probably haven’t heard of it.

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:21.646
“It’s an island where society and women’s rights have

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:25.746
progressed FAR beyond what you ladies have here in England.”

00:05:26.846 --> 00:05:28.116
This got their attention.

00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:31.126
The ladies crowded around me to learn more.

00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:36.286
“This sounds very interesting,” said the one in charge.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.586
“I’m Elizabeth, by the way.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:41.056
We’ve heard of very interesting things going on in

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:46.036
Paris, but please explain the situation in…er… Sardesia.”

00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:49.786
“Women can vote,” I said.

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.066
The ladies gasped and looked at each other.

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:55.976
“Marvellous!”, “Wonderful!”

00:05:57.366 --> 00:05:58.526
“But that’s not all.

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:02.166
Women can and do work in any job.

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:05.326
There are women in the government, women in the police,

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:09.326
women captains of industry and women in the army!”

00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:14.253
More shocked expressions of delight, and some puzzled faces.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.870
“ The army?” enquired Elizabeth, “I thought you said Sardesia is a small island.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.040
What kind of army does it have?”

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.510
“Er…” I hesitated.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.370
I needed to be smarter about the things I said.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.670
“Admittedly, our army only consists of ten soldiers, but five of them are women!

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.190
In fact, we have laws that make sure companies hire women.”

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.780
“And if women work, who takes care of the children?”

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.290
“Well,” I replied, “we have laws that allow parents to

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.850
take time off their job when their children are young.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.650
And when they are a bit bigger, the government provides nurseries for them.”

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.967
From their facial expressions, I could see that they were quite shocked.

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:05.605
It must have been a lot to take in.

00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:08.975
But wait until they hear about the other stuff!

00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:13.145
One piped up, she started to speak.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.825
“My name’s Emily; I think all of this is wonderful!

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:20.265
I want to ask about your dress.

00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:24.565
You have dye in your hair, you’re wearing trousers,

00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:29.815
and your blouse…” she giggled, “has a rude word on it!

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:33.415
Do all Sardesians dress this way?”

00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:38.905
As she mentioned the ‘rude word’, several of the women looked quite unhappy.

00:07:40.175 --> 00:07:46.415
“Why, yes,” I said, “The point is that anyone can dress however they like!

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:49.155
Have you worn trousers before, Emily?”

00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:52.985
Emily blushed, her face turning a deep red.

00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:57.855
“Well, I’ve thought about it!”, she said quietly.

00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:02.605
“Well, I think it’s ridiculous!” one of the women stated.

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:07.215
“Voting is one thing, but why would we want to look like men?

00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:09.725
What’s next, men wearing dresses?”

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:18.235
“Actually…” I replied, “In my…er… country, it’s fine for men to wear dresses and some do!

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:21.355
We believe in exploring your gender identity.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:24.335
“Take me, for example.

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.325
I’m ‘gender fluid’.

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:32.435
Usually I identify as a woman, but there are some days that I identify as a male!

00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:35.115
And I have a girlfriend!”

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:41.185
There was a crash as one of the women dropped her placard on the floor.

00:08:41.985 --> 00:08:43.975
Most of the others looked quite shocked.

00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:46.245
Had I pushed it too far?

00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.405
No, of course not, I told myself.

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:53.265
They needed to hear such things to become more enlightened.

00:08:54.575 --> 00:09:00.665
“Do you mean to say,” said Elizabeth, “that on certain days, you behave like a man?”

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:05.275
Hmm, maybe it was too much for her to understand.

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:14.055
“No,” I corrected her, “on certain days I AM a man.”

00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:17.815
Now I had them really confused…

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:23.595
“But then how…” she thought for a while, “how can you claim to be

00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:28.495
a feminist and protest against the ‘patriarchy’ if you ARE a man?”

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:31.125
“Well, I… uh…”.

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:35.395
To be honest with you, I struggled to find an explanation

00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:39.075
simple enough for this woman and her unenlightened times.

00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:43.325
“If you ask me, I think it’s wonderful,” Emily chipped in.

00:09:43.826 --> 00:09:50.716
“ Sometimes I feel like I want to be a man… Tell us more about your society...

00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:54.162
but be fast because we still need to plan for the march.”

00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:56.232
“Okay.

00:09:56.812 --> 00:10:02.662
In our society, most people don’t eat animals; we’re vegan - we don’t

00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:07.252
eat meat, drink milk, or consume anything that involves animals.”

00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:15.452
“I’ve heard of such things,” said Elizabeth, “but it surely can’t be very good for you.

00:10:15.742 --> 00:10:17.012
It’s not natural.”

00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:22.002
I paid no attention to her ignorant comments, and pushed on.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:29.802
“And we believe in equality amongst races - an area I think you lot need to do

00:10:29.802 --> 00:10:35.382
some work on”, I said, looking around at the group of exclusively white faces.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:40.292
“Oh, and men can marry men and women can marry women.

00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:45.572
We’re free… although, I admit there are still some MEN

00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:49.122
who could use some corrections to their behaviour.”

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:55.282
Looking around at the confused and disgusted expressions on the faces of these women,

00:10:55.702 --> 00:11:02.302
with the exception of Emily, that is, I wished that I could stay here in THIS time.

00:11:02.692 --> 00:11:07.852
There would be so much work to do - it would be great, they needed someone like me!

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:13.162
Back in my own time, it was boring to be an activist, there wasn’t much work to do.

00:11:13.802 --> 00:11:20.482
Most people were perfectly open-minded, except for some of the boneheads I worked with, of course.

00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:25.922
Just then, a woman came running and yelling from the direction of the door.

00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:27.002
“Police!

00:11:27.142 --> 00:11:27.812
Police!

00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:29.402
They’re coming to raid us!

00:11:29.562 --> 00:11:31.232
They’ll be here in a few moments!”

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.522
“Fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Elizabeth.

00:11:35.002 --> 00:11:36.712
“Everyone go out the back!

00:11:37.082 --> 00:11:38.632
Take the placards and signs!

00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:42.582
I’ll stay and deal with the police and we can postpone the march until next weekend.

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:43.352
Now, go!”

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:50.192
The women did as commanded, leaving Elizabeth, Emily and me alone in the warehouse.

00:11:50.952 --> 00:11:52.032
Emily looked at me.

00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:54.022
“I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to…”

00:11:54.212 --> 00:12:01.409
“Morning, ladies!” a lone policeman walked in carrying a truncheon - a large wooden stick.

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:06.059
“Well, well, what do we have here, then?

00:12:06.869 --> 00:12:11.679
Shouldn’t you lot be home prepping dinner for your husbands or doing the washing up?”

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:16.399
I felt my blood begin to boil at this hateful language.

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:19.069
God, he was an awful human being.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.709
He might even be worse than Winston…

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:27.829
“And what do we have here?” He was examining me.

00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:31.799
“Looks like one of the circus freaks escaped!

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:37.999
Dear me, you can’t go around dressed like that, and with an obscenity written on your blouse!

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.319
I can book you for that, young lady.”

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:45.702
“I’ve been arrested plenty of times, don’t worry,” I whispered to Elizabeth and Emily.

00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:47.562
“Arrested?

00:12:47.798 --> 00:12:50.542
I thought your country was ‘free and open-minded’?

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:51.979
hissed Elizabeth.

00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:57.749
“Now then ladies, stop all that whispering and explain yourselves.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:02.229
What are you doing here this fine afternoon?”, the officer said.

00:13:03.109 --> 00:13:05.059
Elizabeth was the first to speak.

00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:07.799
“We haven’t broken any laws, Officer.”

00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:10.839
“Exactly!” I added.

00:13:11.489 --> 00:13:15.059
“And if anyone’s a freak, it’s you, you ignorant chump!”

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:19.189
The policeman looked like he was going to explode with rage.

00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:23.779
“I’m not going to let a circus freak speak to ME like that!”

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.699
His truncheon came down against my thigh.

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:29.949
He should have aimed elsewhere, though.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:33.239
I was still standing and it didn’t hurt that badly.

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:38.819
I knew something that the policeman didn’t - Thai kickboxing - and

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:41.429
I swivelled and cracked him in the face with my foot.

00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:45.954
The cop fell to the ground, holding his face in shock.

00:13:46.664 --> 00:13:48.014
I may have broken his nose.

00:13:48.564 --> 00:13:51.654
Emily and Elizabeth were equally in a state of shock.

00:13:52.204 --> 00:13:56.974
I picked up the truncheon he had dropped and slapped it against the palm of my hand.

00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:00.054
“Didn’t see that coming, didya?”

00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:05.464
Unfortunately, that was the moment that the rest of the police entered the warehouse.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:08.754
Ten of them, all with their truncheons out.

00:14:09.524 --> 00:14:14.874
They looked at their fallen comrade on the ground and then looked at we three women in disbelief.

00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:19.424
I knew we were no match for them, and I put my hand into my pocket

00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:23.894
and felt around for my chronotrigger, my ticket out of there.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.234
I turned to the two girls.

00:14:27.674 --> 00:14:30.888
“I’m not really from Sardesia,” I told them.

00:14:31.798 --> 00:14:32.788
“I’m from the future.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:34.428
Keep protesting, sisters!

00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:36.488
One day you’ll be free!”

00:14:37.438 --> 00:14:39.478
Then, I pressed my chronotrigger.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.656
Back in the lab, everyone was waiting.

00:14:46.726 --> 00:14:51.726
“I was kind of hoping you’d return naked, like I did,” Jacob quipped.

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:57.456
“So did you enlighten them?” asked Winston, sarcastically.

00:14:58.226 --> 00:14:59.086
I sighed.

00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:02.276
The patriarchy was alive and well.

00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:05.626
Perhaps I should have stayed in the past…

00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:12.461
“ Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:17.891
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:23.463
Ellie was played by Anna Tyrie, from English Like a Native.
