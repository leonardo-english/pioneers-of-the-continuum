00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:34.866
Five members of our team had already travelled back in time and had their own adventures.

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.146
Now it was my turn.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:43.976
“Gabriel, I hope you’re ready to be disappointed!” said Winston, somewhat unhelpfully.

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:50.166
Out of all seven members of our team, I was the only one who was in any way religious.

00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:56.446
I mean, my faith wasn’t unwavering, it wasn’t rock solid, but I was raised in a

00:00:56.446 --> 00:01:02.166
Christian home, we went to church on Sundays, prayed before meals, you get the picture.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:07.156
So, what better way to use a time machine than to travel back

00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:11.146
to the time of Jesus Christ and try to meet Him for myself.

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:17.636
I mean, I could answer questions about religion that people have been debating for centuries!

00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:19.546
Who wouldn’t be interested?

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:23.876
It’s fair to say I didn’t have the full support of the team.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.276
“You’re wasting your opportunity,” Jacob told me.

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:31.506
“There is nobody called Jesus of Nazareth.”

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:36.366
“It’s all just fairytales that propagate the patriarchy,” said Ellie.

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:40.986
“He was friends with poor people and prostitutes,” I said weakly.

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.116
“Right, and I’m supposed to believe that?

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:48.716
He could’ve run back to his bourgeois carpenter parents whenever he wanted.”

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:50.756
I sighed.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:53.106
Sure, I had my doubts.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.986
And finding him would be hard enough – I only had an hour.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:02.096
The Bible doesn’t provide hard dates and, even though we date calendars

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:06.617
from the year that Jesus was born, most experts agree that the year 0

00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:11.196
is not His actual birth date and that He was born a few years earlier.

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:15.636
In addition to that, I would be travelling to a parallel universe,

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:20.276
close in the spectrum to our own, but there could be differences.

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:26.036
I mean, who knows… maybe His name wouldn’t even be Jesus!

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:34.206
However, my personal theory was that Jesus would appear in the same way across all timelines.

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:36.206
God’s plan and all that.

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:40.466
My plan, on the other hand, was to arrive in Nazareth when

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:44.846
Jesus was around 30 years old, just before He began teaching.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.486
He should still be living there at that point.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:51.736
But still, there were so many things that could go

00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:55.236
wrong… I was worried my trip would be for nothing.

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:59.536
Still, I wasn’t about to let the others see me doubting.

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:01.496
I had something to prove.

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:08.636
“Ready!” I told the others, crouching inside the box that would transport me back through time.

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:12.046
I nodded to Winston, who was operating the controls.

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:16.706
“Enjoy your trip, chump!” said Winston as he pressed the button.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.059
The sights, smells and sounds of ancient Nazareth hit me.

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:33.599
Look, when you watch historical films about the Bible, you see the less

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.949
pretty sides: the busy markets, the herds of animals, the cruel Romans.

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:44.599
But smelling them is something else completely, and right now, I was

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.429
surrounded by a group of goats who looked like they were considering

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.549
whether I was going to give them food, or whether I might be food.

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.329
“Easy, easy,” I said, pulling my robe away from a goat who was cautiously tasting it.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:00.919
I looked around.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.909
I was in a village or small town of what looked like around 2000 people.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.959
A man came up to check what all the noise was about, and judging

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.769
by the holes in his robes, he must’ve been the owner of the goats.

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.609
Frowning, he said something to me in Aramaic.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.999
“Do you speak Hebrew?” I asked in Ancient Hebrew, hoping my pronunciation was correct.

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:30.879
You see, there’s still debate today about the pronunciation of three specific consonants.

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.609
Jacob told me he was sure they were ‘ejective’, so I

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.329
tried to pronounce them like I was about to throw up.

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:41.969
With the smell of the goats, I was pretty close.

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.619
Anyway, most people at the time spoke Aramaic, with Hebrew as a second language.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.089
But there weren’t many resources for Aramaic in 2039, so I had spent

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:56.969
the last nine months learning as much Ancient Hebrew as I could.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.589
“Oh, sure,” replied the man, using the same ejective consonants as I had.

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:05.309
Jacob was right.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.229
“What are you doing in there with my goats?”

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:11.079
Time to think quickly.

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:18.549
“I…er… I think I had a little bit too much wine and must have fallen asleep.”

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.219
The man was not impressed.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.219
“You’re certainly dressed like an idiot.

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:30.859
Let me guess, someone put their finger in your wine cup and said they’d turned it into water?

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.629
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:34.729
Get out!”.

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:38.769
I climbed over the wooden fence and looked at the man.

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.369
He was dressed in simple robes, like the ones I was wearing.

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:47.079
With my next question, he would probably think I was insane.

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.419
“Could you tell me, Sir, who the current governor of Judea is?”

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.369
The man frowned.

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:56.509
“You mean Prochorus?”

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.189
Prochorus?

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:01.619
I was hoping the name would be Pontius Pilate.

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:05.859
There was no such person as a Prochorus who was governor of Judea.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.059
Not in my timeline, anyway.

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:13.069
Now there was no way to know if I had arrived at the correct time or not.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.949
“One more thing,” I added, “I’m looking for a man who goes by the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.419
He’s a preacher.

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:24.719
Or he may be a carpenter.”

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.079
Showtime.

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:28.629
I crossed my fingers.

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.529
“You are a strange fellow,” replied the man.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:39.009
“There are plenty of Jesuses, preachers and carpenters around here and they’re all ‘of Nazareth’.

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:43.059
But, yea, I know of one who’s a carpenter.”

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.589
He turned and pointed towards the outskirts of town.

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:52.269
“Walk that way for a few minutes and you’ll see a yellowish house on the right with no gate.

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.139
There’ll be a couple of sheep milling around.

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.409
That’s where Jesus the carpenter lives and works.”

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:06.859
I thanked the man and walked on anxiously, wondering if this could really be THE Jesus.

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.589
I saw some yellowish houses, but they all had gates.

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:15.449
The people I saw were simple peasants, engaged in manual labour of

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:19.356
various kinds - carpentry seemed to be a common occupation here.

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:26.406
I smiled and relished the idea of telling Ellie just how ‘bourgeois’ a profession it was.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:31.246
Finally, I came upon a house that fit the description:.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:34.886
yellowish, with a kind of open-air workshop at the back.

00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:38.766
There was no gate and several sheep sat inside the compound.

00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:41.516
Was the owner not afraid of them escaping?

00:07:42.006 --> 00:07:44.136
I heard hammering coming from out back.

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:49.429
My chest tightened.

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:51.079
Could this be Him?

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.819
Until this moment, the idea of having my religious beliefs confirmed

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:01.839
or denied had only registered vaguely with me, like a young child who’s

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:05.359
been told they’re going to a place called ‘school’ for the first time.

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:08.779
Did I actually want to know the truth?

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:14.679
I walked nervously to the back of the house and was shocked to see, not a grown

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:20.339
man of nearly thirty, but a strapping teenager of perhaps sixteen or seventeen.

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:23.319
He was working away with his back towards me.

00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:28.939
If this was Jesus Christ, something had gone wrong with my quantum coordinates.

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:33.349
Or maybe he was just a lot shorter than in all the pictures.

00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:36.801
Good morning", I called out in English.

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:42.131
It was my theory that Jesus, being of divine origin, a worker

00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:45.611
of miracles, would understand me if I spoke in English.

00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:48.891
Plus, my throat was tired from the Hebrew.

00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:51.041
The young man turned to me.

00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:56.401
Like in the pictures in my church, he had long flowing hair and a beard and was

00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:01.741
wearing simple robes, but his skin was darker, like the other people I had seen here.

00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.531
Well, that made sense.

00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:07.271
Otherwise, he’d be awfully sunburnt.

00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:13.411
“You come to me speaking a strange tongue,” replied the young man in Hebrew.

00:09:14.051 --> 00:09:16.031
“You look like you have questions.”

00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.771
I decided to get straight to the point.

00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:22.621
“Are you Jesus, son of Joseph?” I asked.

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:26.811
“I am Jesus, son of David,” replied Jesus.

00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:30.911
“Do you come here seeking carpentry, or something else?”

00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:32.905
I groaned.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:39.371
Half of the male population of Nazareth was probably named David and the other half Jesus.

00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:46.001
When I got back to 2039, the others would roll on the floor laughing at my wasted trip.

00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:48.881
But something occurred to me.

00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:52.941
The way he had asked whether I was seeking carpentry or

00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:57.061
something else… It was an odd way to phrase the question.

00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:01.491
Jesus of the Bible wasn’t exactly the most straightforward speaker.

00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:06.251
You didn’t have your words written down and repeated for thousands of years if

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:11.051
you said things like, “Yeah, it’s just about being nice to people, isn’t it?

00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:12.521
Pretty simple, really.”

00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:17.711
Plus, he had understood my English, so this young man was either

00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:23.691
exceptionally good at reading body language or, in fact, a divine being.

00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:28.161
“I’m seeking something else,” I said boldly.

00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:33.501
“Is that so?” said Jesus, laying down his tools on the workbench.

00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:41.141
“I find a good solid bed frame is enough to solve most people’s problems, but have it as you like.

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:43.691
What is it that you wish of me?”

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.361
Another cryptic question.

00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:47.361
Good.

00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:48.891
We were getting somewhere.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.961
“Answers,” I stated.

00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:56.101
“To get answers, first you need to ask questions.

00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:02.281
But I have a lot of work ahead of me, so I will only answer five questions.”

00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:04.591
I considered his words.

00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:11.221
‘I have a lot of work ahead of me.’ He could be talking about his upcoming ministry!

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:14.661
Or… he might just have a lot of work.

00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:20.671
His bench was piled high with materials, and my Hebrew wasn’t perfect, either.

00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:25.941
My mouth went dry, but I did not want to waste a question asking for water.

00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:29.561
The questions I had been considering for years sat on

00:11:29.561 --> 00:11:33.101
the edge of my tongue, waiting for the baptism of speech.

00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:37.711
But I couldn’t just go out and ask directly about his divinity.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.451
This was before his great works.

00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:43.391
“My first question is this.

00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:48.721
You say that you are a simple carpenter, but I think you are more than that.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.351
Is that true?”

00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:54.801
Jesus picked up a piece of wood and held it out to me.

00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:59.291
“The beautiful thing about carpentry is that we take a

00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.081
thing which has no value or purpose… and give it one.

00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:11.431
This wood began as a fallen tree, but it will live on as a table, a chair or even something greater.

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:15.341
Hence the task of the carpenter is a noble one.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:20.401
Judge me by my actions and my example, not my profession.”

00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:24.701
I considered his words, and suddenly wished I’d paid

00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:27.891
more attention in religious education lessons at school.

00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.851
He was a slippery one, I thought.

00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:34.351
And then I immediately felt bad for thinking such a thing.

00:12:35.181 --> 00:12:40.121
But my impression of him so far was less ‘the future saviour of

00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:44.971
mankind’ and more ‘kid who’s a bit too smart for his own good’.

00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:51.721
“What I meant was, you’re going to go on to do great things in your life.

00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:53.861
Not related to carpentry.

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:55.591
What will they be?

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.521
I think you know.”

00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:00.981
Jesus raised his eyebrows.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:07.621
Perhaps it had a different meaning in this time, but it felt like he was finally understanding me.

00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:12.751
He ran a hand over his carpentry tools as he spoke, as if distracted.

00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:16.881
“My time on Earth is to be short.

00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:21.021
If I’m not a carpenter, perhaps I’ll be a fisherman.

00:13:21.681 --> 00:13:26.981
Perhaps I’ll be a shepherd and give my life to save the humble lamb from the fearsome lion.

00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:32.401
Or perhaps I’ll be a teacher, since that’s what you seem to think I am.”

00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:40.301
In the Bible, Jesus asks his followers to ‘walk his path and become fishers of men’.

00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:43.761
And the Bible refers to Jesus as the Lamb.

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:50.621
But also, at Jesus’ birth an angel came to tell some shepherds the good news.

00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:53.791
The message felt… mixed.

00:13:55.381 --> 00:13:58.781
As I pondered this, I noticed something surprising.

00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:05.171
Amongst the tables, chairs and shelves, a wooden cross leaned against the wall of his workshop.

00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:08.981
The type of cross that was used to crucify criminals

00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:12.401
and people who spoke out against the Roman occupation.

00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:18.131
I pointed to the cross and asked, “Why would you build such a thing?

00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:21.371
The Romans use this to torture and kill people.”

00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:23.671
Jesus just smiled.

00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:29.971
“There are things that belong to this world and things that belong to the next.

00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:34.381
If ‘Caesar’ wants a cross, then I shall build him a cross.

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.931
Consider a criminal who is executed.

00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:41.271
It takes time for a man to die by crucifixion.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.391
In that time, what thoughts go through his mind?

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:46.951
Does he repent?

00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:49.311
Does he beg God to forgive him?

00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:53.311
Perhaps the cross is the path to redemption.”

00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:57.461
The cross is the path to redemption?

00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:00.371
That’s exactly what Jesus would say!

00:15:01.061 --> 00:15:07.021
But… it also sounded like what a carpenter might say if he had to decide

00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:11.871
between his conscience and a Roman officer testing his own cross on him.

00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:16.211
I decided to go with something more abstract.

00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:19.271
“Why does God allow suffering?”

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:22.161
Jesus answered with a parable.

00:15:22.931 --> 00:15:25.861
“Once, a man was preparing for his wedding.

00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:29.001
It would be the best day of his life.

00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:32.691
But this man had a bad habit of sleeping late.

00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:36.891
Every day, his father woke him with a slap across the face.

00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:40.031
It was the only way to rouse him from his bed.

00:15:40.591 --> 00:15:44.171
His father reserved the most painful slap of all for his son’s

00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:48.591
wedding day, and he struck him so hard that he fell out of bed.

00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:51.201
“What do you think?

00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:54.771
Was the man filled with rage from his father’s slap?

00:15:55.341 --> 00:16:00.151
Or was the pain overshadowed by joy for the great event that lay ahead?”

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.081
I considered his words.

00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:08.361
It was hard to get over the excitement of hearing an original parable, though

00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:12.681
I somehow imagined they wouldn’t be adding it to the next edition of the Bible.

00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:18.011
Then again, this could just be a common form of discussion at this time.

00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:25.761
I wanted to believe that this man was Jesus Christ, but I couldn’t shake the doubt from my mind.

00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:28.721
And I only had one question left!

00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.601
“Lord Jesus, what spiritual advice do you have for me?”

00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:36.991
The young man smiled.

00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:39.431
Because I had called him ‘lord’?

00:16:40.931 --> 00:16:43.911
“You obviously come from somewhere far away.

00:16:44.411 --> 00:16:47.141
Do you not have a religious text where you come from?”

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.731
“We do,” I said.

00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:51.901
“I think you know of it.

00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:53.591
It’s the Bible.”

00:16:54.691 --> 00:16:58.931
“And does this ‘Bible’ not contain wisdom and guidance?”

00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:00.501
“It does.

00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:01.761
Great wisdom.”

00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:08.861
“Then surely any spiritual advice you need from me can be found in the words of that book.”

00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.871
Hmm, it seemed like I was getting somewhere.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.271
Time to pry a little further…

00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:18.571
“But… how…?”

00:17:19.001 --> 00:17:24.551
Jesus raised his hand in the air, holding it out, as if to say enough.

00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:29.927
“You’ve asked five questions and I’ve given you five answers.

00:17:30.151 --> 00:17:33.701
You know all that you need to know from this carpenter.”

00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:38.951
And he turned and resumed his work, hammering some nails into place.

00:17:41.212 --> 00:17:43.592
This was clearly my signal to leave.

00:17:44.262 --> 00:17:47.542
As I wandered out of the gap where the gate should be, lost in

00:17:47.542 --> 00:17:52.002
thought, I bumped into the man I had first met, the owner of the goats.

00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:54.791
He was herding them down the narrow road.

00:17:55.371 --> 00:17:57.771
“Ah, the strange drunk man!

00:17:58.181 --> 00:17:59.721
Did you find Jesus?”

00:18:00.381 --> 00:18:07.373
“I think so, but… I’m not sure,” I replied, reaching into my robe for the chronotrigger.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:14.171
I decided to present him with my own miracle: “the disappearing man”, and I pressed the button.

00:18:14.831 --> 00:18:21.071
But just before the trigger activated and I was thrown back into the future, I heard something.

00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:29.151
Words that I had heard before, but only in my mind, so quiet I could’ve imagined them.

00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:31.721
Could it really be?

00:18:32.991 --> 00:18:36.501
A voice as soft as a sheep’s wool had spoken to me.

00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:39.401
“Goodbye, my son.”

00:18:40.971 --> 00:18:44.501
The voice spoke not in Hebrew, but in English.

00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:54.849
By the time I had turned around, Nazareth had disintegrated, and I stood back in my own time.

00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:57.899
“Well?” said Winston.

00:18:58.199 --> 00:19:00.289
“Did you find your lord and saviour?”

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:02.209
I smiled.

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:06.017
“That’s a question I cannot answer.”

00:19:10.285 --> 00:19:13.915
Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:19.345
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:24.987
Gabriel was played by Ariel Goodbody from Easy Stories in English.
