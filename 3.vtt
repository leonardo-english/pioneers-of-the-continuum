Pioneers of The Continuum.

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:10.237

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:34.354
After the last time travel adventure where Bobby “the Greek” went on patrol

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:38.734
with a group of Romans and almost got himself killed, everyone was happy

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:43.954
to send me on a nice, safe trip just twenty-seven years into the past.

00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:48.664
There would be no Hitler, no Caesar, just a happy family reunion.

00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:52.674
I would get to see my father, who died before I was born.

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:56.204
In fact, I was planning to make sure that he didn’t die.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:03.005
You see, my father was a trainee astronaut for one of the first private space companies.

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:06.945
He never got to go to space - he died in a simulator

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:10.635
during training, leaving my mother heartbroken and alone.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:13.405
And she was pregnant at the time, with me.

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:19.895
“Why not visit ancient Egypt, Marcie?” asked Bobby, his finger over the launch button.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:25.115
“You’re going to do something as uneventful as going back three decades?

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:28.965
It seems like all you want to do is make up your own soap opera!”

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:32.665
“Shut it, you idiot!” I told him, half playfully.

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:36.115
See, Bobby was actually my closest friend in the group.

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:39.955
I thought he might even have a bit of a thing for me…

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:44.035
“You got to do your thing; now I get to do mine.

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:45.185
Push the button.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.565
Let’s get this show on the road”, I told him.

00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:50.353
Smiling, Bobby pressed the button.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:01.411
On TV, when you travel through time, you fall through a swirling tunnel of colours.

00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:03.611
For us, it wasn’t like that at all.

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:08.541
One world disappeared and another instantly appeared in its place.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.399
I was in a very familiar place, my old bedroom, the bedroom I grew up in!

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:21.929
But this was before I was born and it was a guest bedroom, filled with boxes and unwanted clothes.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.029
I opened the door and walked softly downstairs.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.369
The smell of coffee brewing came to me from the kitchen.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.609
Entering the living room, I noticed that the sofa had blankets

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.049
and pillows on it, as if someone had been sleeping there.

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.279
Strange!

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.209
I sat down.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.419
The sofa looked brand new.

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.749
It was almost thirty years old when I last sat on it.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.529
“Hello!” I called out.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.861
My mother appeared in the kitchen doorway, a look of shock on her face.

00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:57.151
She looked young, beautiful, with flowing locks of red hair, just like the pictures.

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.621
Obviously, she was somewhat surprised to see me.

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:02.981
“Who are you?

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:04.381
How did you get in here?”

00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:06.001
I smiled at her.

00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:09.771
I may as well just come out with it and tell her the truth.

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:12.041
“Mom, I’m your daughter.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.781
I travelled here from the future.”

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:16.185
There was silence.

00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:18.755
I could hear the clock ticking on the wall.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:26.015
She was staring right at me, looking at me like I was mad but clearly something had clicked.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:29.595
After all, I did look a lot like her.

00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:33.605
I figured I’d tell her something nobody else would know.

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:35.095
“You’re pregnant, right?

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:36.355
About 8 weeks by now?”

00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:40.525
My mother’s jaw dropped in shock.

00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:41.785
“How did you…?

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.185
I haven’t told…”

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.665
“You’re not showing yet, but that’s me in there.”

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:49.835
I stepped forward and placed my hand gently on her stomach.

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:51.245
She flinched a little.

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:52.515
“That’s me!

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:53.715
Imagine that!

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:55.765
There are two of me in the room right now.

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:56.695
Isn’t that cool?”

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:01.415
Mom sat down on the sofa, processing what I was saying.

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:08.555
I knew she had always believed in wacky and weird things - aliens, ghosts, government conspiracies.

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:12.035
I was hoping that this would help her to accept my story.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.702
As soon as she opened her mouth, I realised I was wrong.

00:04:18.742 --> 00:04:22.012
“Okay, you somehow got into my house and you somehow

00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:24.912
know about my baby, but you’re not from the future.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:27.972
You’re trying to trick me; do you think I was born yesterday?

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.680
You had better explain yourself and fast or else I’m calling the police.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.800
And my husband will be back from work any minute now.”

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.570
Damnit.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.330
Time for Plan B.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.760
“Here’s the proof,” I said, rolling up my sleeves.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.970
I activated the touch screen on my arm and began to project images on a nearby blank wall.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.350
Images of my mum holding me as a baby.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.560
Images of my mum taking me to school.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.670
Images of my mum at my fifth birthday party.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.580
I was hoping the device would convince her that I really was from the future.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.180
Hopefully, it was ‘futuristic’ enough.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.410
After all, it was only 2012.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.970
Even the “iPhone” was quite new back then!

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.180
“Should I keep going?”, I asked, not sure that my mum

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.850
would want to see pictures of herself getting older.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.100
Mum was thinking hard.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.160
I needed her to believe me.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.930
But she seemed somehow distracted, something else was on her mind.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.890
“David isn’t in any of the photos.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.060
Your…er…father, I mean.”

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.790
I took my mother’s hand in mine.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.330
“That’s why I’m here.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.490
I know you love David - Dad - very much; you’ve told me so many times

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.130
how happy you were and how proud you were of his space programme.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.160
“You also told me how you argued with him that the programme wasn’t safe.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.780
Well, you were right and he was wrong.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.683
He’s leaving for training tomorrow and - in my

00:05:56.683 --> 00:06:00.239
memory - he dies a week from now in a training accident.

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:01.379
In a simulator.

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:03.297
He never goes to space.”

00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:06.517
My mother’s face was unreadable.

00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:09.497
I looked for signs of sadness, but saw none.

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:11.377
“That’s why I’m here.

00:06:11.377 --> 00:06:13.447
We can fix it, I can fix it for you.

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:14.847
I’ve thought it through.

00:06:15.317 --> 00:06:20.267
We can ask him to refuse to go in the simulator until they’ve done further checks.

00:06:20.687 --> 00:06:24.897
He won’t die and perhaps he can go into space and fulfill his dreams.

00:06:25.357 --> 00:06:26.997
I’ll grow up with a father.”

00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:30.577
She paused, looking blankly at the wall.

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:34.577
“He dies in a simulator…” Mum repeated.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.327
“  That’s… convenient.”

00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:41.717
She whispered the last word so that I could barely hear it.

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:43.317
“Convenient?” I cried.

00:06:43.317 --> 00:06:43.997
“What do you mean?

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:46.087
It doesn’t sound convenient to me…”

00:06:47.027 --> 00:06:51.517
“Listen,” my mum said, brushing my hair with her hand, “I do believe you.

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:52.527
My beautiful daughter!

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:54.307
You’re lovely, by the way.

00:06:55.337 --> 00:06:58.877
But, isn’t it dangerous to come back here and change things?

00:06:59.347 --> 00:07:02.417
Won’t it… mess things up for you when you get back?”

00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:04.547
“That’s not how it works.

00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:09.898
I’ll be fine.”  Our team had agreed that we could reveal ourselves as time

00:07:09.898 --> 00:07:14.148
travellers, but we would keep secret the part about parallel universes.

00:07:14.538 --> 00:07:20.298
This was a different timeline and whatever happened here would have no effect on our own.

00:07:21.818 --> 00:07:25.118
“Just now, what did you mean by ‘convenient’?” I asked again.

00:07:25.658 --> 00:07:27.568
Mum let out a long sigh.

00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:30.608
“There are things you don’t know.

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:35.978
Yes, you might have all the fancy gadgets in the world, but there are still things you don’t know.

00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:40.228
It seems that I haven’t been - or won’t be - truthful with you.

00:07:40.758 --> 00:07:44.028
Perhaps it’s time to come clean and tell the real story.

00:07:45.388 --> 00:07:48.868
“For weeks I had suspected that David, your father,

00:07:48.908 --> 00:07:51.648
was being unfaithful, that he was cheating on me.

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:56.078
Three days ago, I caught him with his secretary.

00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:59.078
In the drawer over there are divorce papers.

00:07:59.618 --> 00:08:02.648
I’m planning to get him to sign them when he gets home tonight.”

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:05.568
“Ohhh…” I said.

00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:11.608
Like jigsaw puzzle pieces locking into place, a picture began to form.

00:08:12.538 --> 00:08:14.648
The blankets and pillows on the sofa.

00:08:15.248 --> 00:08:18.088
Dad must have been sleeping down here after a big fight.

00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:22.428
It would be ‘convenient’ if he died in a training accident.

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:26.988
Rather than face the shame of a messy divorce and an unfaithful

00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:31.668
husband, Mum could always claim to be the victim of a romantic tragedy.

00:08:32.418 --> 00:08:38.188
Yes, she argued with Dad before he left for training, but not about how dangerous the mission was.

00:08:38.788 --> 00:08:42.038
The argument was about whether or not to divorce.

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:47.228
Bobby’s words came back to me: making up your own soap opera.

00:08:48.438 --> 00:08:53.408
What this woman was going to do was what my own mother had already done!

00:08:53.688 --> 00:08:58.168
The version of my family history that I knew was a lie.

00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:02.628
Sitting there in the living room, I didn’t even know

00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:05.368
whether to talk about it in the past or the future.

00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:09.408
I looked up to see tears streaming down my mother’s face.

00:09:09.738 --> 00:09:10.578
She was crying.

00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:15.848
“If he… if he…” she sobbed, “If he dies a week from now…”

00:09:16.338 --> 00:09:17.268
“Mum, no!

00:09:17.408 --> 00:09:18.418
We have to tell him.

00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:20.148
We have to do the correct thing.”

00:09:20.948 --> 00:09:24.818
“If he dies a week from now, I won’t need to go through with the termination.”

00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:27.718
I sat in stunned silence.

00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:29.745
Termination.

00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:33.794
She had been planning to get rid of the baby, of me!

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:39.044
The final piece of the puzzle fell into place, the picture fully formed.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.560
I thought of the times I had watched television with my mum.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.790
She hated romantic movies, especially the ones where someone cheated and was later forgiven.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.420
One of our neighbours, Michelle, forgave her husband

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.990
for an affair and later had a daughter with him.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.470
My mum had called it disgusting.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.180
You should only ever conceive a child in love, she said.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.160
Like me, she said, I had been conceived in love.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.540
But that was a fantasy, a lie.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.470
The accident had changed my mother’s mind about the abortion, about me.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.910
I suppose the divorce was never finalised either.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.220
She never told a soul.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.920
God, she wanted her husband to die in an accident so she could live her life her way.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.070
Her story.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.270
Talk about making up your own soap opera.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.030
I felt disgusted.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.300
I shouldn’t have come here.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.880
I shouldn’t have meddled.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.570
“Young lady.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.960
You never told me your name.” Mum was still sobbing.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.050
“Marcie.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.380
It’s short for Marcella.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:47.649
You named me after Grandma, your mother.”  “But my mother’s name isn’t Marcella.”

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:49.619
Damn!

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:53.879
I forgot that this timeline might have some differences from my own.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:57.709
Now she might go back to thinking that I was trying to fool her.

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:01.839
But I was saved by the sound of a car pulling up outside.

00:11:02.609 --> 00:11:06.009
I looked out of the window to see a blue Audi in the driveway.

00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:10.969
I recognised it from old photos, but in my timeline it was yellow.

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:14.749
Dad entered the house and paused when he saw me.

00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:18.669
It was the first time I had ever met him in person, of course.

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:20.389
He was strikingly handsome.

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:22.269
A handsome young astronaut.

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:25.329
A handsome young cheating astronaut.

00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:29.999
“You have a guest…” he said sheepishly to my mum.

00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:35.059
I guess he had expected to come home to more fights and arguments about his affair.

00:11:36.393 --> 00:11:41.043
Thinking quickly, I rose to my feet and offered my hand for him to shake.

00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:42.869
I thought of a plan.

00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:44.239
“Mr Welles?

00:11:44.429 --> 00:11:45.399
My name is Marcella.

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:47.759
You don’t know me, but I know you.”

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:51.829
“Um...okay…” he said, shaking my hand.

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:53.969
He could see that Mum had been crying.

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.259
“I’m involved in the Aris project, like you.

00:11:57.719 --> 00:11:58.809
Or at least I was.

00:11:58.839 --> 00:11:59.929
I’m… a whistleblower.”

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:02.329
“A whistleblower?”, he repeated

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:06.079
“I was fired from the Aris project for raising safety concerns.

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:08.819
You know how quickly the project has moved.

00:12:08.989 --> 00:12:14.499
I know you really want to go into space; you must be looking forward to your training next week.

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:20.169
But I’m here to warn you… safety standards are terrible, even with the simulators.

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:22.079
There’s a high chance of an accident.

00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:23.669
A very high chance.

00:12:25.229 --> 00:12:27.399
“I’m taking this to the authorities, of course.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.359
But I also wanted to come and warn you in person.”

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:35.279
Dad looked from me to Mum then back to me, in disbelief.

00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:40.179
“Anyway, I’ve said what I wanted to say and I’ve discussed it with your wife.

00:12:40.409 --> 00:12:42.599
Whether you continue or not is up to you.

00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:47.029
You can discuss it with your wife and decide on the best course of action together.

00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:47.689
Good day.”

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:53.919
I walked out of the living room, opened the front door and stepped outside without looking back.

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:56.339
I readied my chronotrigger.

00:12:57.329 --> 00:12:58.429
Did I do the right thing?

00:12:58.909 --> 00:13:00.489
I left it to them to decide.

00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:02.519
But to do so, I had to lie.

00:13:03.319 --> 00:13:05.449
My mother lied to me my entire life.

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:07.899
My father lied when he had an affair.

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:09.819
And now I was a liar, too.

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:13.249
Just one part of a family of lies.

00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:15.059
I pressed the button.

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:21.086
I was back in my own time.

00:13:21.306 --> 00:13:23.196
The team were all waiting for me.

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:28.046
Later, I’d have to consider how to face my mother back in this timeline.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.946
“How was your soap opera?” asked Bobby.

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:33.146
“You were right,” I told him.

00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:35.656
“Maybe I should have gone to ancient Egypt.”

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.049
Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:49.479
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:54.985
Marcie was played by Lindsay McMahon from All Ears English.
