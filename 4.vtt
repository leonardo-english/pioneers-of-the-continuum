Pioneers of The Continuum.

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:09.032
A story for English learners.

00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:18.371

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:30.491
“Really, Jacob?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.511
A lighter?

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:32.841
A chocolate bar?

00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:34.261
Beef jerky?

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:35.701
A backpack?

00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:38.921
You’re giving all this to a group of cavemen?”

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:42.591
I sighed to myself.

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:47.311
Winston seemed to have changed since getting back from his journey through time.

00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:52.661
Now he was suddenly “very concerned” about my journey through

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:56.751
time, a journey that I was about to leave on in a few minutes.

00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.471
Did I really have to tell him again?

00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:04.791
“Winston, I’ve told you before; they’re not ‘cavemen’.

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:10.301
And I won’t be able to communicate with them, so I'll need to bring gifts.

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:16.711
I’ll give them chocolate and if they don’t like it, they’re sure to like the beef jerky.

00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:19.531
The lighter is to impress them.”

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.981
Seems reasonable enough, right?

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.991
Clearly it wasn’t enough for Winston.

00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:30.251
“Well, I don’t like it at all,” he said.

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:32.861
“You’ll end up inventing fire for them.

00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.531
You’ll change the course of history of an entire world.”

00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:42.081
It was almost as if he couldn’t see how hypocritical he was being!

00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:44.081
Someone needed to tell him.

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:48.281
“But that’s exactly what you were going to do!

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:52.231
You killed a historical figure, did you not?

00:01:52.851 --> 00:02:01.161
Anyway, humans invented fire 300,000 years ago and I’m travelling back to 100,000 years ago.”

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.498
“  Don’t leave anything there!”, he added sarcastically.

00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:10.838
I couldn’t wait to get away from him and finally have a bit of peace.

00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:13.788
“Okay, everyone,” I said.

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:16.418
“Listen, I need to focus.

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:19.818
I’m pretty much ready, just press…”

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.199
Bobby was quick on the trigger, pressing the button to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.509
launch me through time before I even finished my sentence.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.139
He knew how much Winston and I fought and figured sending me back

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:42.669
100,000 years into the past was a good way of keeping us apart.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.490
Aha, peace at last!

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:54.788
I was alone on the slope of a hill covered with trees and grass, somewhere

00:02:54.798 --> 00:03:00.208
in what would become East Africa, and all was completely silent and peaceful.

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.979
The chill in the air reminded me that we were in a minor ice age.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.419
Wonderful!

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:14.669
I would have loved to sit and enjoy the scenery and the silence, but I wanted to find some humans!

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.719
Winston had ignorantly called them “cavemen”.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.889
It’s not that our ancestors only lived in caves, but caves

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.029
were the main places where their bones were preserved.

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.969
Maybe they lived in wooden houses.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.549
We didn’t know, but perhaps I would find out.

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:43.798
At this time, different species of humans lived on Earth, including our own species: homo sapiens.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.729
I chose this spot because cave art had been found here,

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.069
just at the top of this hill, a few hundred metres away.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.009
Suddenly, a completely unexpected sound filled the air.

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:05.183
Singing!

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:08.123
And quite beautiful singing, too.

00:04:11.124 --> 00:04:15.294
I turned to see an old man and a young woman approaching.

00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:21.764
The woman was the one singing, and the man carried a wooden spear with a stone head.

00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:27.704
They wore animal skins, sewn crudely together and they walked upright.

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:31.114
The girl wore a necklace made of shells.

00:04:31.634 --> 00:04:37.044
Their dark features were those of modern humans - they were homo sapiens!

00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:42.854
They stopped a few metres away and stared at me, especially my clothing.

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:48.864
Understandable, I guess, I was wearing a suit and tie after all.

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:53.574
I smiled at them, but they didn’t smile back.

00:04:54.474 --> 00:04:57.164
Would smiling even have a meaning to them?

00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:01.974
I took off my backpack and took out the chocolate bar.

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:08.874
The man immediately jumped back and thrust his spear towards me to protect himself.

00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:11.704
He pushed the girl behind him.

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:13.864
“Easy, fella!

00:05:14.184 --> 00:05:16.394
Look, I’ll share some food with you.

00:05:17.074 --> 00:05:17.854
Food!”

00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:22.104
I removed the chocolate from the wrapper, and showed it to them.

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:25.084
Everyone loves a Mars bar, right?

00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:29.714
“Coho?” said the man with a bemused expression.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.714
I realised my mistake.

00:05:33.304 --> 00:05:41.034
A chocolate bar to these people would look like… well, it would look like a dried animal dropping.

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:48.584
I had learned my first prehistoric word, “coho” and it seemed to mean “poop”.

00:05:49.664 --> 00:05:53.484
I was recording this on my arm implant and the other team

00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:56.624
members would laugh when they found out what my first word was.

00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:02.214
“Food!” I said, breaking it in two and eating half.

00:06:02.814 --> 00:06:04.784
I offered the other half to the man.

00:06:05.557 --> 00:06:09.584
“Benge!” he exclaimed, taking it and putting it into his mouth.

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:11.954
I watched him carefully.

00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:16.024
He chewed, swallowed and looked at me.

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:21.934
Then he said something to the girl, who removed a shell from her necklace and gave it to me.

00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:23.734
Trade!

00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:27.884
I had only been here five minutes and I was already

00:06:27.884 --> 00:06:32.224
learning rich details about their culture and language.

00:06:32.784 --> 00:06:33.624
Amazing!

00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:38.274
I shifted my focus back to the present.

00:06:38.694 --> 00:06:40.684
Well, the past, I guess.

00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:44.784
The man and girl turned and started walking off.

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:46.704
Was that it?

00:06:47.714 --> 00:06:50.704
But after a few steps, they looked back at me.

00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:52.734
They wanted me to follow.

00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:54.844
I ran to catch up.

00:06:55.964 --> 00:06:57.734
“I’m JACOB.

00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:06.824
My name is JACOB.” I felt a bit foolish talking to them as if they were kids, but it seemed to work.

00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:11.284
“Acan o wato HAMSABE,” the man said.

00:07:12.044 --> 00:07:15.734
He pointed at the girl, “Dana e wate ALLERAMA.”

00:07:17.044 --> 00:07:18.574
This was fantastic!

00:07:19.434 --> 00:07:22.204
If I could record enough samples of their language,

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:25.314
I could reconstruct it when I got back to the lab.

00:07:26.094 --> 00:07:32.004
Unlike some of the others on my team, I was a serious scientist - an

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:37.904
archaeologist and a linguist, not some pseudo-historian who killed Hitler.

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:44.844
As we were walking, I let the man and girl talk to each other, while I listened and recorded.

00:07:45.624 --> 00:07:49.884
I was amazed at how rich and varied their language was.

00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:55.934
It seemed to have a grammar, and it seemed to be very expressive.

00:07:56.754 --> 00:08:01.554
They were talking about me and pointing to my backpack and my modern clothes.

00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:07.444
I guessed they wanted to take me to their settlement to trade further - although

00:08:07.644 --> 00:08:12.784
I later found out that they had something a little different in mind…

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:17.274
As we cleared the top of the hill, I gasped.

00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:23.164
There was the opening to the small cave where ancient art had been

00:08:23.164 --> 00:08:28.314
found - perhaps it had already been painted there or perhaps not.

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:33.534
Surrounding the cave on the outside was a small circular

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:37.174
group of huts, not quite amounting to a village.

00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:40.884
It looked like around 20 people might live here.

00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:47.304
A group of women were squatting in the open area, sorting through leaves and berries.

00:08:47.924 --> 00:08:49.914
A huge fire kept the group warm.

00:08:51.194 --> 00:08:52.824
There were no other men.

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:54.964
But, of course!

00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:58.224
This was a hunter-gatherer society.

00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:01.984
The young men must be out hunting in the valley.

00:09:02.754 --> 00:09:05.264
Perhaps they’d return later with their catch.

00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:07.754
They could even be gone for days.

00:09:08.874 --> 00:09:12.034
As we entered the settlement, the women all turned and

00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:16.304
stared, then came to see this strange man for themselves.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.794
Hamsabe introduced me.

00:09:19.678 --> 00:09:21.734
“Adengo a JACOB.

00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:24.984
Kinomaro ko moto an ALLERAMA.”

00:09:26.134 --> 00:09:27.274
He remembered my name!

00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:30.244
But why had he repeated the girl’s name?

00:09:30.614 --> 00:09:31.364
Allerama.

00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:35.634
The most elderly woman in the group came up to me.

00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:38.414
Was this Hamsabe’s wife?

00:09:38.994 --> 00:09:44.744
No… she looked like a shaman - a magic specialist of some kind.

00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:49.664
This old shaman brought her face close to mine… and sniffed.

00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:51.378
“Watara!”

00:09:52.584 --> 00:09:58.384
I’m not sure if she liked my smell - deodorant and aftershave, but she

00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:02.974
certainly smelled like someone who hadn’t spent much time in the shower.

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:08.474
She walked around me and pulled at my clothes, fascinated by them.

00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:14.574
Then, she picked up my backpack, playing with the zip a few times before opening it.

00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:16.914
She pulled out the lighter.

00:10:18.144 --> 00:10:19.274
“Gomana os?”

00:10:20.364 --> 00:10:23.104
I took it from her and showed her how to operate it.

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:30.119
[ [ She tried it successfully and then a few times more while the others watched.

00:10:30.719 --> 00:10:34.269
She burnt her hand and dropped it, then picked it up again.

00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:36.489
“Too e gonna kianna?”

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:41.069
Obviously, I had no idea what she was asking.

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:43.719
Was she asking where it was from?

00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:45.819
Did she want to keep it?

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:47.969
Was she asking to trade?

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:52.889
Later, I could analyse the recording in detail and find out.

00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:57.169
But for now, I was just struggling to figure out what she wanted.

00:10:58.039 --> 00:11:00.119
“A kotte ni ALLERAMA.

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:00.869
Garna.”

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:04.029
Why was she saying the girl’s name again?

00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:05.509
What was going on?

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:11.159
I had imagined myself showing these wondrous items from the future to a

00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:16.719
group of confused primitives, but I was the one who was confused here.

00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:21.819
The old man - Hamsabe, I think - took me by the shoulders

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:25.129
and positioned me in a spot at the front of the village.

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:31.029
Then, the girl - Allerama - came forward and placed a necklace of shells

00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:36.979
around my neck, then another and another until I had five necklaces.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.209
Why were they doing this?

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:43.389
These necklaces must be of great value to these people.

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:47.189
I couldn’t believe they would give them away so freely.

00:11:48.064 --> 00:11:53.969
Then, Allerama stood beside me and Hamsabe handed me five more necklaces.

00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:57.579
He motioned for me to put them around the girl’s neck.

00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:01.609
The truth hit me like a rock.

00:12:02.719 --> 00:12:06.569
This was some kind of…marriage ceremony!

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:13.079
“No, no,” I said, shaking my head, this was some huge misunderstanding!

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:15.809
Hamsabe just stared at me.

00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:22.094
He didn’t understand “no” and he didn’t understand what shaking my head meant.

00:12:23.194 --> 00:12:24.654
I reconsidered.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:28.414
Well, why not go through with the ceremony?

00:12:29.024 --> 00:12:32.964
After all, this would be valuable research!

00:12:33.464 --> 00:12:39.564
I would be out of here before too long - all I needed to do was play along until then.

00:12:40.534 --> 00:12:50.074
So, I turned and placed the necklaces one by one around Allerama’s neck, slowly, playing for time.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.494
I had never been married before.

00:12:54.314 --> 00:12:58.264
In fact, I had never even had a girlfriend.

00:12:59.384 --> 00:13:08.014
Back “home” in 2039, I had an “artificial companion”, a robot who took the role of a wife.

00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:16.744
It was really quite common, especially given that the male population outnumbered the female by 57%.

00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:23.044
Having a human wife was something I’d never even considered as a possibility.

00:13:24.154 --> 00:13:27.704
But here we were, 100,000 years ago.

00:13:28.554 --> 00:13:32.674
I’ve only been here for less than an hour and I’m already getting married!

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:40.224
What’s more, Allerama was actually quite beautiful - which made it even worse.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:45.574
She had long dark hair and big bright eyes.

00:13:46.604 --> 00:13:51.334
She… didn’t smell too great in this age before shampoo and

00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:55.064
perfume, but I hoped I wouldn’t get close enough to find out.

00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:57.914
I guessed her age at about twenty.

00:13:59.134 --> 00:14:06.554
She put the palm of her hand against my face and, after some hesitation, I put my palm against hers.

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:09.574
The villagers broke into a song.

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:12.005
Were we married?

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.955
The shaman lady came forward and took my backpack.

00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:20.082
I stopped her just long enough to remove my chronotrigger.

00:14:20.675 --> 00:14:22.305
I might need it really soon!

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:28.745
Winston wouldn’t like it if I left my lighter and other stuff here, but that was too bad.

00:14:30.085 --> 00:14:34.885
The villagers escorted us both towards the cave, where the art had been discovered.

00:14:35.825 --> 00:14:39.895
I had a feeling that I was about to discover its purpose.

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:46.910
At the mouth of the cave, the villagers stopped and we entered accompanied only by the shaman.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.790
The cave was narrow and dark, but also familiar - I had

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.530
actually visited it a month ago, 100,000 years from now.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.690
We proceeded further into the darkness of the cave, about 50 metres

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:08.060
or so and away from the singing and prying eyes of the villagers.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.280
There was a sudden flash of light, as the shaman worked my lighter.

00:15:15.663 --> 00:15:20.973
This was the furthest part of the cave and I was stunned to see the same

00:15:20.993 --> 00:15:26.093
art that I was familiar with, but in much richer colours and greater detail.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:34.013
Here were stories of hunts, battles and angry gods, before time had caused them to fade.

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:41.463
There was a small fire hearth in the centre of the chamber and the shaman lit it with my lighter.

00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:47.653
She didn’t burn her fingers this time; she was getting the hang of it.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:54.573
Next, she chanted a few words over the fire hearth, and left me alone with Allerama.

00:15:55.673 --> 00:15:58.043
We looked at each other for a few moments.

00:15:59.263 --> 00:16:00.433
Was this my wife?

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:05.523
She took the bottom of my shirt and said, “Tomona?”

00:16:06.813 --> 00:16:11.133
Was…this… some sort of ceremony to bless our wedding?

00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:18.823
She removed my shirt, pulling it over my head,  and then pointed at my trousers and shoes.

00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:22.173
Were we supposed to make love?

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:27.823
That is what newly married couples do, or used to do at least…

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:33.343
I gulped, nervously, fingering the chronotrigger in my hand.

00:16:34.213 --> 00:16:35.143
I should go.

00:16:36.213 --> 00:16:37.469
But I wanted to stay.

00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:39.139
My hour wasn’t up.

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:43.369
I realised I was going to have to break a prehistoric heart.

00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:47.689
Shyly, I removed my trousers and shoes.

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:54.569
And then my underpants, which, ridiculously, carried the Batman logo on them.

00:16:55.659 --> 00:17:00.159
I stood naked before my bride in this cave of wondrous

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:04.179
prehistoric art, but I wouldn’t let this go any further.

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:06.289
Or would I…?

00:17:07.499 --> 00:17:11.159
Allerama took me by the shoulders and pushed me to my knees.

00:17:11.979 --> 00:17:14.619
Then, she started sifting through my hair.

00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:17.939
What was she doing?

00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:22.676
She was grooming me, brushing my hair!

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:28.209
I suppose she expected to find lice or other creepy crawlies in my hair.

00:17:29.209 --> 00:17:32.089
“Bakwa!” she exclaimed when she didn’t find any.

00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:38.089
She moved onto my beard for a few seconds, stroking with her fingers and finding nothing.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.329
Then she lifted my arm…

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.432
… and triggered my implant.

00:17:43.572 --> 00:17:48.722
The artificial section of my arm slid back, revealing a touchscreen, which

00:17:48.732 --> 00:17:54.242
immediately began beeping loudly and projecting images onto the wall of the cave.

00:17:55.132 --> 00:17:56.472
Allerama screamed.

00:17:57.225 --> 00:18:01.135
A loud, piercing scream which blasted my eardrums.

00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:07.035
“Shh!” I told her, but she just kept on screaming at the top of her voice.

00:18:07.825 --> 00:18:12.295
The villagers would be here any second… probably with spears.

00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:14.725
I decided not to find out.

00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:17.685
I pressed the chronotrigger and…

00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:24.494
And I was back in the lab with the team.

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:28.134
My clothes, on the other hand, weren’t.

00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:34.554
I was stark naked, not even my Batman pants had made it back.

00:18:35.734 --> 00:18:38.464
“WHY are you NAKED?” Ellie asked.

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:43.594
“And where’s your backpack… and your lighter?” asked Winston.

00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:49.004
“It’s a long story,” I said, covering myself with my hands.

00:18:49.904 --> 00:18:52.294
“Can someone pass me some clothes?”

00:18:56.876 --> 00:19:00.506
Pioneers of the continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:19:01.136 --> 00:19:05.936
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:11.702
Jacob was played by Tom Wilkinson from Thinking in English.
