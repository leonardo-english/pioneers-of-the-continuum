Pioneers of the Continuum.

00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:08.744
A story for English learners.

00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:16.754
Episode one, "Killing Hitler", guest starring Luke Thompson from Luke's English Podcast.

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:31.825
The machine that they put me in was nothing much to look at.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:33.725
It was a tiny metal box.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:38.755
So tiny, in fact, that I needed to curl up into the foetal position

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:42.925
just to fit inside it, you know, like I was in my mother’s womb.

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.465
Still, I couldn’t complain.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:49.915
After all, I was the one who had designed this tiny metal box.

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:54.725
If it was any bigger, it could cause problems on… the other side.

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.335
As the small team of scientists, my friends, made

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:02.875
the final preparations, I allowed my mind to wander.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:07.875
For the past few weeks, getting to the lab every day had been harder and harder.

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:12.715
At first, there were only a few protesters, but the number grew and grew

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:16.805
into the hundreds until it was hard just to drive through the crowd.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:20.885
I chuckled as I recalled some of their protest signs.

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:22.825
“NO TO TIME EXPERIMENTS”.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:24.925
“BAN QETT NOW!”.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:26.995
“MAN MUST NOT PLAY GOD”.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:30.425
Luckily, they had no idea what we were up to today,

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:33.285
or they would probably burn the place to the ground!

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:39.465
“Almost ready,” said Marcie, who had taken the role of our lead engineer.

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:40.735
I nodded.

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:44.415
I had spent the last two months brushing up on my

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:48.585
German and studying the Fuhrer’s movements in 1939.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:53.505
Today would be the first time that a human travelled through time.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:57.955
I was travelling back 100 years to 1939.

00:01:58.435 --> 00:01:59.065
My mission?

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.005
I was going to kill Adolf Hitler.

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:09.284
It was indescribable.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:14.154
In the blink of an eye, one world was gone and another was in its place.

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:15.694
It was cold.

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:16.579
Damp.

00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:18.288
The box was gone.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:22.288
I uncurled from the foetal position and looked around.

00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:28.308
On the walls were expensive cognac, bordeaux, burgundy and champagne.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.418
I was in a wine cellar, the wine cellar of the

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:37.058
Kehlsteinhaus - the Eagle’s Nest - Hitler’s favourite retreat.

00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:39.428
It had worked!

00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:43.288
This was the exact location we had programmed into the machine.

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:47.258
Hitler was probably upstairs somewhere, plotting with his

00:02:47.258 --> 00:02:51.848
generals or doing whatever megalomaniac dictators do to relax.

00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:57.318
I had one hour to find him and kill him, before I had to return.

00:02:58.488 --> 00:03:01.328
As I tell this story, I know what you might be thinking.

00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:04.628
If I kill Hitler, I’ll change the entire course of

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:08.078
history and I’ll return to a completely different world.

00:03:08.748 --> 00:03:12.118
An event of that magnitude would affect everything… maybe

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:15.178
my parents would never meet and I would never be born!

00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:18.478
Would killing Hitler kill me, too?

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:25.668
Quantum Entanglement Through Time, or QETT as we call it, doesn’t work that way.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.248
It allows us to travel back through time, but to a parallel universe.

00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:37.658
I will kill Adolf Hitler here in this timeline and free this world from tyranny.

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:41.188
But when I return home, everything will still be the same.

00:03:42.018 --> 00:03:47.288
I can’t change the past in my timeline, but I can change it in a different timeline.

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:48.218
See?

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.848
It’s so nice and neat.

00:03:49.988 --> 00:03:53.288
There are no moral dilemmas - although the protesters won’t

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:57.698
believe it - no consequences to me, my friends and my world.

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:04.708
But this world… the world I was travelling to, will be spared the horrors of World War Two.

00:04:05.998 --> 00:04:11.668
The trick, you see, is to travel to a timeline which has very little variation from our own.

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:16.388
After all, there’s no point travelling to a timeline where Hitler never existed.

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:18.148
Or where he was the good guy!

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:22.398
I mean, it would be interesting, but I was here for a purpose.

00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:26.508
I smoothed down my uniform and checked my pistol.

00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:28.258
Everything was in order.

00:04:29.148 --> 00:04:32.245
I carefully opened the cellar door and peeped out.

00:04:32.928 --> 00:04:34.688
The corridor was empty.

00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:39.398
According to my research, the Fuhrer should be here with Eva

00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:43.558
Braun - his lover - some generals and just a couple of guards.

00:04:44.678 --> 00:04:48.898
I tiptoed further along the corridor and something interesting caught my eye.

00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:53.808
It was a banner with a swastika on it, the sign of the Nazi party.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:57.238
But instead of the red background that I was familiar

00:04:57.238 --> 00:05:00.558
with, the swastika was set against a GREEN background.

00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:01.758
YES!

00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:06.348
This was the first proof that I was indeed in a parallel timeline.

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:08.438
Little things would be different.

00:05:09.028 --> 00:05:12.348
I could rest assured that killing Hitler here wouldn’t have

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:16.158
any nasty consequences in my own timeline when I returned.

00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:21.828
I snapped a picture of the banner using the device embedded in my arm, and moved on.

00:05:23.452 --> 00:05:25.272
I found a window looking outside.

00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:30.612
Four guards in military uniform were chatting and smoking beside the entrance.

00:05:30.974 --> 00:05:36.884
They wore green swastikas and their helmets were an odd shape, different from the photos I had seen.

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:38.894
This was good…very good.

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:44.634
Hitler had posted the guards at the entrance so that he could be alone inside with his family.

00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:48.934
Now to find him… and put a bullet in his head!

00:05:50.044 --> 00:05:53.344
I came to a large room with five people sitting in it, facing

00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:57.194
away from me, towards the fireplace and chatting animatedly.

00:05:57.864 --> 00:06:01.264
One, I recognised as Eva Braun, Hitler’s lover.

00:06:01.854 --> 00:06:04.244
The others were surely family members.

00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:05.664
Hitler was not there.

00:06:06.424 --> 00:06:08.664
Again, this was fantastic news!

00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:11.894
Hitler must be upstairs in his study, by himself!

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:16.034
That meant that I could take my time, maybe speak with him a little bit

00:06:16.044 --> 00:06:20.944
first, before dispatching him, before putting a bullet in his brain.

00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:26.284
I sneaked slowly up the spiral staircase, removing my pistol from

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:30.554
its holster and finally arriving at a closed door at the top.

00:06:31.184 --> 00:06:35.104
From inside the room, I heard a cough but no other sound.

00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:36.714
This was it.

00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:37.754
Showtime!

00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:42.194
I took a deep breath and gently opened the door.

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:46.556
There he was!

00:06:47.086 --> 00:06:48.026
There was my man!

00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:52.706
Adolf Hitler sat behind a huge wooden desk, reviewing paperwork.

00:06:53.136 --> 00:06:57.566
His black hair was parted harshly to one side in his trademark style.

00:06:58.576 --> 00:07:01.306
The little moustache that was so famous was gone.

00:07:01.836 --> 00:07:05.636
In its place was a huge, bushy one, making him look more like

00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:09.346
an American Civil War general than a 20th century dictator!

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:16.076
Through the open window behind him lay the mountains and fresh air of southeast Germany.

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:18.576
Hitler looked up and saw me.

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:22.306
His eyes narrowed and he rose to his feet.

00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:25.536
“Shhh!,” I said, showing him my pistol.

00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:29.476
I motioned for him to sit down, and he did so.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:33.566
“Wer bist du?” he asked with obvious contempt.

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:37.606
Speaking in German, I told him my name:  Winston.

00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:42.916
My father was a big fan of Winston Churchill and he named me after him.

00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:46.536
It’s how I became so interested in this historical period.

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:49.006
“Winston?” Hitler scowled.

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:49.886
“Are you British?

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:51.046
What do you want?

00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:52.826
How did you get in here?”

00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:55.706
“I’m from the future”, I told him.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.186
“100 years in the future.

00:07:57.906 --> 00:07:59.586
I travelled back in time to get here.”

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:01.926
He stared at me blankly.

00:08:02.696 --> 00:08:04.906
It was hardly surprising that he didn’t believe me.

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:07.096
I needed to find a way of convincing him.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:09.236
“Watch this,” I said.

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:13.336
I pressed a button on my left arm to reveal the embedded screen.

00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:17.416
I pulled up the calendar app and scrolled to today’s date.

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:18.796
I mean, the date when I left.

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:21.426
August the 20th, 2039.

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:25.066
Hitler’s eyes widened as he saw the device.

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:28.566
I knew that he was interested in magic and the supernatural.

00:08:29.126 --> 00:08:33.096
He probably thought it was magic, some sort of sorcery from the future!

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:35.056
I was sure he believed me.

00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:36.802
“ Why are you here?”

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:40.792
I told him the truth, that I had come to kill him.

00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:44.672
To my surprise, he didn’t flinch, or reach for the pistol

00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:48.242
on his desk; he didn’t look scared or nervous at all.

00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:52.402
“If you have come to kill me, then why haven’t you done it yet?

00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:56.922
You don’t have long; my guards come to check on me every 15 minutes.”

00:08:57.932 --> 00:09:00.742
I pointed my pistol directly at Hitler’s forehead.

00:09:01.462 --> 00:09:02.472
“I have time.

00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:04.582
A little time,” I said.

00:09:05.062 --> 00:09:05.902
And continued.

00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:08.722
“You’re about to invade Poland.

00:09:09.252 --> 00:09:12.042
When you do, it will trigger a second great war.

00:09:12.382 --> 00:09:13.791
We call it World War 2.

00:09:14.472 --> 00:09:16.972
Millions upon millions of people will die.

00:09:17.242 --> 00:09:21.562
Millions of Jews will be put in camps and executed, women and children too.

00:09:21.972 --> 00:09:28.052
New weapons will be invented - atomic bombs that can kill hundreds of thousands in a few seconds.

00:09:28.992 --> 00:09:32.552
“And it will all be for nothing because you’ll lose this war.

00:09:32.752 --> 00:09:36.732
Germany will be destroyed and your enemies will divide the country into two.

00:09:37.262 --> 00:09:40.632
The name ‘Hitler’ will become hated throughout the world.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:45.822
100 years from now, people will call each other ‘nazi’ or ‘hitler’ as an insult.”

00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:48.992
Hitler was listening intently.

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.622
Finally, he spoke.

00:09:52.912 --> 00:09:53.632
“  You’re lying.

00:09:53.942 --> 00:09:57.642
Why would you travel back in time to kill me… if I LOST?

00:09:57.842 --> 00:10:00.012
That is the part that I don’t believe.

00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:02.602
No, I don’t think I will lose this war.

00:10:03.122 --> 00:10:04.092
I think I will WIN.

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:06.472
And THAT is what you have come back to change.

00:10:06.732 --> 00:10:08.352
You’re an enemy of the Third Reich.

00:10:08.512 --> 00:10:09.192
That is all.”

00:10:10.392 --> 00:10:15.252
I shook my head and accessed a newspaper from 1945 on my device.

00:10:16.362 --> 00:10:19.112
I tapped the screen and projected it onto the wall.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:22.062
Another tap and it was translated into German.

00:10:23.162 --> 00:10:28.102
The headline read “Hitler Dead”, in capital letters, and that

00:10:28.132 --> 00:10:32.182
the Allies had defeated Germany and the war in Europe was over.

00:10:32.912 --> 00:10:34.792
Hitler read it disbelievingly.

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:36.842
I had failed to convince him.

00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:37.962
“Go ahead.

00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:39.332
Shoot!” he dared me.

00:10:40.362 --> 00:10:42.332
I pointed the gun again at his face.

00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:45.072
Beads of sweat formed on my forehead.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:51.592
It’s not an easy thing to kill a man, even Hitler; I hadn’t quite realised this until now.

00:10:52.442 --> 00:10:53.632
My hand was shaking.

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:54.592
I couldn’t do it.

00:10:55.142 --> 00:10:56.962
I decided to give him a way out.

00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.032
“It doesn’t have to be this way,” I said.

00:11:00.372 --> 00:11:01.232
“You can change.

00:11:01.272 --> 00:11:04.662
Give me your word that you won’t invade Poland and I won’t shoot you.”

00:11:05.592 --> 00:11:06.972
Hitler shook his head.

00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:12.062
“What is your world like, this 2039?

00:11:12.722 --> 00:11:14.682
I think it must be quite nice.

00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:16.202
You look healthy.

00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:18.182
You’ve invented time travel.

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:21.162
You obviously have these advanced technologies.”

00:11:22.002 --> 00:11:23.792
I nodded as he spoke these words.

00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:26.312
“Then, why do you wish to change the past?

00:11:26.522 --> 00:11:31.772
Win or lose, war or no war, how do you know that a different future would be better?

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:33.222
How can you be sure?

00:11:34.032 --> 00:11:38.432
Perhaps in the final analysis, killing me is not the solution you think it is.”

00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:42.642
We stared at each other across the table for a long time.

00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:44.512
He was thinking hard.

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:47.822
I could see that I'd planted a seed of doubt in his mind.

00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:52.972
The thing was…he had also planted a seed of doubt in mine.

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:56.342
Could a future with no Hitler be worse?

00:11:56.832 --> 00:12:02.692
World War Two had inspired nations to seek peace in order to never again face its atrocities.

00:12:03.082 --> 00:12:05.442
With no Hitler, would that still happen?

00:12:06.272 --> 00:12:07.122
Two men.

00:12:07.612 --> 00:12:08.612
Two seeds.

00:12:09.142 --> 00:12:10.572
Time was running out.

00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:12.562
I pulled the trigger.

00:12:17.218 --> 00:12:23.198
You see, I didn’t pull the trigger on my gun, but on my chronotrigger, my time travel device.

00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:28.518
When I pressed it, I disappeared immediately from 1939, and

00:12:28.518 --> 00:12:33.308
was shot back to the future, back to 2039, back to today.

00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:37.478
Did Hitler, in that timeline, start World War Two?

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:41.898
Or was he a reformed person after his encounter with

00:12:41.898 --> 00:12:44.658
a mysterious man who claimed to be from the future?

00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:46.518
There’s no way to know.

00:12:47.618 --> 00:12:50.518
Events in that timeline have no effect on this one.

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:57.738
And using QETT - Quantum Entanglement Through Time - the choice of timeline is somewhat random.

00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:04.268
It’s extremely unlikely that anyone could ever return to the same one and find out what happened.

00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:09.418
It’s a strange situation, and I don’t blame you if you’re struggling to wrap your head around it.

00:13:10.098 --> 00:13:14.358
But the strangeness, and indeed, my story, was just beginning.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:19.418
After all, this was only the first of the missions that we would undertake.

00:13:19.908 --> 00:13:24.608
And next time, we would be travelling even further back into the past.

00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:33.158
Pioneers of The Continuum was a Leonardo English production.

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:38.588
The story was written by Emile Dodds and me, Alastair Budge.

00:13:39.158 --> 00:13:44.288
Winston was played by Luke Thompson from Luke's English Podcast.
